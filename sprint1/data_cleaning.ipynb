creatures of pearu . \\n as of apros 30th , 1945 -- the gates of pearu will be closed and all damned creatures of pearu are hereby debarred from entering the mortal world . \\n any creatures of the damned found outside the gates of pearu entering the world of mortals , shall be sentenced to death and their souls obliterated . \\n this ruling has been created due to the damned interference and impersonation of one adolf hitler . \\n due to his role in the killing of innocent mortals and the assassination of adolf hitler , echidna zobyverth korfmann and his army shall be sentenced to death by the hands of zeus in front of the gates of pearu . \\n the continuing search for dethroned queen eris is still underway . \\n any creature found aiding and abetting eris will be found as a betrayer and sentenced to death . \\n with regards , kavos priam king of pearu prologue october 31 , 1947 it was once written that if a creature of the damned was seen in the world of mortals that the god zeus would descend and convey a fate worse than death . \\n many of the damned no longer believed in this myth , but there were some who had been around longer who knew that there was such a punishment . \\n out of that group only one decided to defy this rule . \\n kithara moved silently through the night cloaked in its darkness . \\n the boots she wore crunched in the brown leaves that had fallen due to the nature of this season . \\n by now everyone would have learned that the gates to their world had been broken and someone had escaped through . \\n kithara found little relief in the fact that it would take them a while to discover who or what exactly had gone through the gates to the mortal world . \\n by that time she would have done what she came here to do , despite the fact that tonight she might be meeting her end . \\n the orange glow from the streetlight irritated her eyes as she averted her eyes away from it . \\n being in mortal form did its job in helping her blend in , but that does n't mean that being in this form did n't frustrate her . \\n she felt confined in this mortal form , not to mention every brush against her arm made waves of disgust roll through her . \\n since it was what mortals called `` halloween '' , the streets where filled with groups of them as they dressed in vibrant colors , carried little weird shaped bags , and yelled something about a trick and a treat . \\n a few of them had come up to her handing out paper flyers or something sweet smelling wrapped in colorful plastics , but she simply kept walking . \\n while she might have disliked the smell of `` their '' kind , that did n't mean she wanted to remove them from existence like those from her world seemed keen on doing . \\n maybe that 's why `` she '' picked her . \\n at the thought of her a smile came to her lips . \\n a male mortal dressed in a black costume , with weird shaped pointed ears on his head , took her smile as interest in him as he opened his mouth to speak to her . \\n kithara sent a glare to him that crushed any form of words he was about to say . \\n the mortal glanced off as she made her way past him , her thoughts once more turning to the person she was doing this for . \\n she did n't have many that she could trust these days except her . \\n there had been a time that when she had no one . \\n when not only her kind , but her parents had turned their backs on her . \\n it was by the graces of whatever superior being that she found herself in an unknown land and in the presence of someone who had been inscribed in her head as the enemy . \\n a week living with her had showed kithara that this enemy had done more for her than her so called family had in a lifetime . \\n it was then she pledge her loyalty to her . \\n it was that moment that brought her here . \\n kithara finally arrived at her destination . \\n staring up at the sign , she felt a sudden surge of fear . \\n she would have to act quickly . \\n the moment she revealed any magic from their world , they would know she was here . \\n kithara entered the hospital quickly and headed for the steel doors that would take her to the floor she needed to be on . \\n a smile came to her lips at the invention of the elevators that the mortals had laid claim to not knowing that in another world veiled within theirs , they had already existed . \\n the doors closed her in as she stared at her mortal reflection in the doors . \\n she was pretty by mortal standards so no wonder the male had taken interest . \\n all too soon the doors opened and she was out of the confined spaced . \\n since it was almost midnight , the floor was silent . \\n the only sounds came from the tapping of keys on the computer and the beeping of monitors in the different rooms . \\n kithara headed down the hall with purpose . \\n a nurse called out to her but she ignored her and kept walking . \\n she was close now . \\n she counted the numbers to the doors in her head until she came upon the one that was needed . \\n pushing open the doors , kithara entered the room and pulled a chair behind the door . \\n the nurse by now would have called security and they would be up any second . \\n turning around she stared at the clear boxes filled with sleeping baby mortals . \\n they were all hooked up to various wires as they fought for their chance at living in this world . \\n maneuvering through them , she ignored the slight whines coming from some of them until she found the one she wanted . \\n staring down at the baby , she allowed her finger to stroke the baby 's smooth skin before quickly pulling away . \\n the baby 's heartbeat was slowing down and soon its soul would move on to another realm . \\n kithara could hear the faint sounds of security as the baby 's heartbeat was finally reaching its end . \\n it was time . \\n reaching into her coat , she removed the silver box from her pocket . \\n it gleamed in the light as the faint hum of magic pulsated around it . \\n she experienced a sudden slight of hesitation . \\n what if the child is left alone in the mortal world ? \\n what if she was discovered by one of her kind , or worst the gods ? \\n no , that would n't happen . \\n she said someone would come for the child . \\n someone would take the child back to their world , where its true identity will remain hidden until time . \\n she had told her this . \\n she trusted her . \\n at ease , kithara released the latch and flipped the top up . \\n running footsteps sounded in the hall as a bright light filled the room . \\n the baby 's heartbeat had finally reached its end . \\n kithara removed the ball of light from the box and held it in her hands . \\n the soul of the child burst from its chest as she quickly replaced it with the glowing ball of light . \\n as the old soul of the baby disappeared so did kithara . \\n teleporting back and forth between states , she released the same amount of power to throw anyone who was watching off her trail . \\n exhausted she landed in the middle of desert . \\n releasing that much power had taken a lot out of her . \\n pulling herself up into a sitting position she stared up at the night sky . \\n `` well was n't that impressive . '' \\n kithara turned around with quickness expecting to see one of the gods or worse zeus himself . \\n but what she was n't expecting was the creature in front of her . \\n kithara had no idea who this creature was or what she was doing outside of the gates . \\n the creature stood six feet tall in mortal form , clutching a silver staff as she stared down at her . \\n something was n't right . \\n kithara tried to back pedal , but found herself trapped in the sand . \\n trembling , she stared up at the figure in front of her . \\n `` who are you ? '' \\n her voice quivered . \\n the creature was surely from their world , and yet , she smelled different . \\n the creature smiled but there was no warmth to it . \\n `` i should be asking you that , kampe . '' \\n she smiled down at her . \\n with a wave of her hand she said , `` reveal yourself . '' \\n kithara tried to fight the change as a final act of disobedience but she should have known better . \\n the creature 's smile proved it . \\n the mortal skin began to fall off as her true self broke free . \\n `` that 's better . '' \\n she said with a smile . \\n `` now tell me what brings you here . '' \\n `` curiosity . '' \\n `` curiosity '' she questioned with a raise of one of her elegant brows . \\n `` yes , mortals . \\n they fascinate me . '' \\n even as the lie rolled off kithara 's lizard tongue , she could n't help the bitter taste the words left . \\n mortals did the exact opposite . \\n before kithara could blink , she found herself gasping for air as the creature 's hand clenched tightly around her throat . \\n `` it would be wise if you do not play with me . \\n someone helped you get through those gates and not just anyone can possess that type of power . '' \\n she ended with a sinister smile . \\n `` so again i ask you , what are you doing here ? '' \\n kithara stared at the creature as it soon became clear why she was here . \\n this creature was a supporter of the dethroned queen eris . \\n unlike the others , this creature had some rank . \\n it was enough for the queen to allow her to enter the mortal world alone . \\n it was enough to send a chill through her . \\n the creature raised an eyebrow waiting for her answer . \\n she knew others in her position would reveal their secrets to her immediately as a favor of freedom . \\n but kithara knew that there was no way she was going to survive this encounter , so why give up any information at all . \\n kithara felt her lips curve up into a smile as she gave her last act of defiance . \\n `` go ahead and kill me . \\n but take caution that the same fate awaits you much sooner than you think . \\n your end is near . \\n in time you will be nothing more than a pawn in eris 's games . '' \\n the creature 's features changed into one of rage as kithara felt the power radiating through her . \\n she gave one last glance up at the night sky before feeling the cold blade slice cleanly , removing her head from her body . \\n part one o f g o d s and d e m o n s out of the night that covers me , black as the pit from pole to pole , i thank whatever gods may be for my unconquerable soul . \\n invictus-by william earnest henley one new york city may 14 , 1964 life has lost its meaning . \\n life was once said to be one of creator 's greatest gifts . \\n a gift so precious that he bestowed it upon the creatures he created , sharing it with the world . \\n yet mortals discard it every second of the day as if it were nothing more than trash . \\n they were an ungrateful kind , but still an intriguing one . \\n the sound of a nearby trashcan being knocked over woke me from my thoughts . \\n peering down into the dark alley from the roof i was perched on , i watched as two mortals entered . \\n they were male and female and did n't appear to be any older than twenty . \\n the male who was dressed in a gray tweed blazer and blue pants , backed the female until her back was against the brick wall of the nearby building . \\n his brown hair was cut down short close to his head and his body reeked of cigarettes and cheap cologne . \\n but i was n't here for him . \\n i switched over to the female who was sighing in contentment . \\n she wore a yellow penciled dress covered by a white flowered cardigan that did n't seem to agree with the cold weather . \\n from my spot on the roof , i could see the sudden chill bumps gracing her legs and arms . \\n her blond hair was held down by a green headband as it fell down to her shoulder . \\n two glistening diamond earrings hung from her ear as her gloved hands gripped the male shoulders . \\n the male whispered something to her and she threw her head back in laughter . \\n i tore my eyes away from them to the watch on my wrist . \\n it was time . \\n turning my eyes from the watch back to the alley , i watched as the male hands reached up to the grasp the girls neck . \\n she smiled at him , her blue eyes glowing despite this darkness . \\n she liked him . \\n she trusted him . \\n it was her mistake . \\n the male let out a menacing growl as he snapped her neck . \\n her body slid down the brick wall as the male robbed her of her jewelry and money . \\n he took one more look at her body before running out the alley , a smile on his face . \\n standing up from my crouched position , i waited until the faint footsteps of the male disappeared before jumping down . \\n i landed on the ground , the noise disrupting the now silent alley . \\n i walked over to the female and crouched beside her body . \\n she was still warm . \\n closing my eyes , i placed a hand on her chest . \\n `` rizay '' the females body trembled as a golden light burst from her chest . \\n it rose and hovered above her body . \\n reaching into my coat , i removed the silver and blue box and opened it . \\n the light floated towards the box filling up the oval shape until it was all in . \\n closing the box , i latched the lock and tucked it back into my coat . \\n my attention turned back to the now cold body of the female . \\n though she had the form of an adult female , she was still just a baby . \\n i could smell the youth that was still humming through her body . \\n she was done and injustice and i wanted nothing more than to track the male down and rip out his larynx . \\n but that was n't my job . \\n i was a reaper . \\n i took souls , not lives . \\n releasing a sigh , i reached over and closed her eyes . \\n i needed to get out of here . \\n standing up , i turned and made my way out the alley leaving behind a lifeless body . \\n the streets of new york were filled with mortals as they made their ways to and from social gatherings that were being held in the wee bit of the night . \\n i tuned out their sounds of laughter , talking , and music as i walked through the crowds . \\n my mood was still a bit dampened from not being able to save the female . \\n i never understood why i was this way . \\n i was from the world of the pearu . \\n we were outcast creatures of the damned who fed on the sadness and evil of mortals . \\n we lived for their destruction and in the past we often caused it . \\n but despite the death of the female , i got a rush from her killing . \\n i reveled in it . \\n it was the part of me that reminded me of who i was . \\n but then there was the other part of me , the part of me that knew that this was wrong . \\n a part of me that felt sympathy for them . \\n a part of me that wanted to know more about them . \\n it was a part of me that i kept hidden and would have to remain hidden . \\n if anyone from my world were to find out the way i felt , i would be ridiculed . \\n i would become an outcast . \\n i would be sentenced to death . \\n i guess i should have been thankful to be a reaper . \\n it was a job most creatures of my world would kill for . \\n being a reaper meant i was allowed to be a part of the king 's circle and live the life of an elite . \\n it also meant that i was able to leave our world and travel to the mortal world whenever i wanted . \\n it was the only perk i loved . \\n my world suffocated me , whereas the mortal world was like stepping into the pages of a fable . \\n pushing away the depressing thoughts , i continued to make my way through the streets of new york . \\n within minutes i had arrived at my last destination . \\n i stood outside the building for a few seconds taking in my surroundings before pushing open the glass door . \\n the lobby of the apartment building was one of lush . \\n the carpet was a wine red as cream sofas and armchairs sat around the room . \\n in front of each sofa was a glass coffee table covered with a centerpiece of flowers . \\n the wallpaper was also cream colored and looked as if it had just been applied . \\n and in the center of the room were four elevators , but i would not be taking them . \\n `` sir , can i help you ? '' \\n i turned my head to the left at the voice . \\n a male in his mid-forties stood behind the security desk . \\n he was a bit of an overweight mortal whose stomach was bulging so much that i could see it peering through the slit of his uniform shirt . \\n there was also a creamy white stain just above his breast . \\n he had a bald spot in the middle of his head as hair clamped to the sides of it . \\n in the midst of his black hair i could spot a couple of gray ones . \\n in his hand he held a sandwich which appeared to be the culprit to the stain on his shirt . \\n his eyes however held a slight fill of fear to them as they roved up and down my body . \\n while he 'd probably had seen some crazy sights before here in new york , my outfit of choice however took first prize . \\n i was dressed in a turquoise blue cotton blazer jacket that buttoned all the way up to my high collar . \\n my legs were covered in a pair of black jeans and on my feet were a pair of black boots . \\n across my chest hung a gold rope belt that was looped two times ending with the gold claw clasping my left shoulder . \\n my demos rested against my back strapped in its pouch , its blue handle illuminating . \\n the clerk swallowed at the sight of my sword and grabbed his phone . \\n but at the sight of my eyes on his , he took a startled step back . \\n his breath caught as he stared at me his mouth ajar . \\n my eyes were as black as a pit that often made mortals feel as if they were falling into them . \\n i tried not to make contact with mortals but every once in a while someone would grab my attention . \\n i was just thankful they would never get to see my true eyes or else they would really lose it . \\n i was a hell demon . \\n i was the type of demon that mortals did n't fear since myth puts us unable to leave our world . \\n it was somewhat true . \\n i gave the male one more glance before walking off in the directions of the stairs instead of the elevator . \\n though he was frozen in fear , i did n't want to take the chance of him breaking out of his trance and stopping the elevator if i got on it . \\n the last thing i needed was to attract attention from the gods by killing one measly mortal . \\n no , the stairs was my best bet . \\n i opened the door that led to the stairs and started to climb . \\n i took each floor without breaking a sweat like mortals would . \\n i finally arrived on the fifth floor . \\n the hall was quiet though i could hear slight snoring coming from one of the rooms . \\n i made my way down the hall until i came to the room i needed . \\n reaching out a hand , i wrapped it around the doorknob and closed my eyes . \\n i let my senses brush out my mind into the room as it began to paint an image of what was happening on the other side of the door . \\n there was a female standing in the middle of the room dressed in a white robe . \\n she held a crystal glass filled with wine in her left hand as she talked into the telephone device attached to her ear . \\n she spoke in a harsh voice to the person on the other line . \\n the smell of fear from the other person on the line made my body tremble with pleasure . \\n no , this is n't right . \\n i should n't be taking pleasure in this . \\n i stepped back from the door and opened my eyes . \\n it was obvious the person on the phone was terrified of the female in this room . \\n not that i could blame them if i were mortal . \\n the female had more anger and hate in her than i 've seen in a mortal female in a while . \\n however , my interest in her did n't matter . \\n it 'll all be over soon . \\n i took a seat outside her apartment door and waited . \\n it was n't long before i heard a hard thud inside the room . \\n pushing up from the floor , i wrapped my hand around the door handle and opened the room door . \\n the living room was empty though there were faint signs from where the female had paced back and forth . \\n i continued through the apartment until i found her . \\n the female lay dead against the bathroom floor -- her blood coating the tiles . \\n she had been so busy yelling on her phone that she did n't notice the floor was still wet . \\n walking over to her , i spoke the words to call forth her soul and placed it in its box . \\n the process was over and i exited her room and headed down the stairs . \\n i entered the lobby once again but this time the male was alert . \\n he stood staring at me , waiting for the chance to see my eyes again , but i kept walking . \\n once i was down the street away from prying eyes , i teleported . \\n a field of wild grass and a manmade dirt path greeted me as i reappeared . \\n i took a second to check my surroundings for norjels . \\n norjels were fallen angels that were trying to earn their wings back by guarding the entrance between the mortal world and pearu . \\n as i sniffed them out , one dropped down out of a tree in front of me . \\n five more jumped out of their hiding places , forming a circle around me . \\n their bodies were formed like mortals , but their backs were bent from all the bowing they had done in honor to the gods . \\n their eyes no longer held the blinding light that angels were born with , instead they were dimmed . \\n shredded gray wings clung to their backs as they move around me . \\n while they no longer possess the physical appearance of an angel , they still had their strength . \\n the norjel , whom had jumped down first , thrust his illuminating blue spear at me as the rest of them followed suit . \\n `` reveal yourself . '' \\n he hissed . \\n `` really yaetis , must we go through this every time . '' \\n `` do not speak my name as if you know me ! \\n and yes , we must go through this every time . \\n now reveal yourself , aristaeus . '' \\n `` so you can call me by name , but i 'm forbidden to call you by yours ? '' \\n yaetis let out a hiss as the others followed him . \\n `` okay , okay . '' \\n i laughed . \\n lifting up my hands in surrender i said , `` i 'll reveal myself . '' \\n closing my eyes , i called forth my true face . \\n the line that separated my mortal form from my true form began to tremble around the edges as my true self threatened the barrier that kept it from the surface . \\n the slight gasps and trembling of metal alerted me to the fact that the change from mortal to damned had been successful . \\n my eyelids parted as i stared through cracked eyes . \\n the field had gone quiet and i knew it was because of my true face . \\n no matter how many times the norjel 's saw my true face -- every revealing was like a fresh nightmare to them . \\n i was n't offended though . \\n i knew what i looked like to them . \\n i had seen it for myself plenty times . \\n i had the face of a mortal but the features of a demon . \\n my face was covered in outlined scales and my eyes were a slant shape that was void of lashes . \\n in the middle were my eyes that resembled broken glass and when i opened my mouth , sharp teeth were displayed . \\n yaetis swallowed tightly . \\n `` okay , you can change back now . '' \\n the transition this time was much smoother and worked calming yaetis down . \\n stepping to the side , he allowed me to past as i gave him a nod of my head . \\n behind me i heard whooshing sounds and knew that they had returned back to their posts . \\n i started down the dirt path as a boom sounded alerting that i had now left the mortal world . \\n we did n't have to worry about mortals discovering our world since only our kind could enter . \\n i continued up the dirt road until i reached the red barn nestled in the middle . \\n two bodyguards stood on the outside imitating a pose they had often seen mortals do at nightclubs . \\n unlike with the norjel 's , i did n't have reveal my true self . \\n they were from the world of pearu , and like all creatures of the damned , we could see right through mortal forms . \\n they opened the doors for me as i stepped into the room . \\n the barn had been transformed into a safe haven for those who 'd been outcast from the world of pearu . \\n the first floor of the barn was a bar and on the second floor were small apartments were the outcast lived . \\n the tables were filed with the usual outcasts , as they sipped out of the clay filled mugs and enjoyed a performance by a band of chimera . \\n i made my way to the bar and plopped down on the seat . \\n os 'm ar , a one eyed minotaur , was the bartender and owner of this place . \\n he 'd been banned from pearu sixty eight years ago during the time the damned were sentenced to live only in their world . \\n os 'm ar had been a worker of zobyverth korfmann , an enchidna that led the mortals to one of the most gruesome killings of their century , the holocaust . \\n zobyverth and his army had been executed outside the gates of pearu by the king of gods , zeus . \\n os 'm ar for some reason had been spared by zeus , fueling rumors that he 'd been the one to betray zobyverth . \\n while king kavos abided the rules zeus set for our worlds , he did n't not abide the same kindness he showed to os 'm ar . \\n kavos ordered the death or imprisonment of os 'm ar . \\n os 'm ar had suffered some bruises and lost an eye , before escaping . \\n it was only by the grace of zeus , that he was able to survive outside the world of pearu . \\n with the closing of the gates , os 'm ar was granted the position as gatekeeper between the both worlds . \\n so far he 'd done a great job at keeping everything in line . \\n spotting me at the end of the bar , he made his way towards me . \\n `` aristaeus , already done for the night ? '' \\n he grabbed a clay mug off the rack and filled it with the green colored liquid i 'd begun to love . \\n he placed it in front of me as i threw it down my throat and waited for him to refill it . \\n `` my list only had a few names on it tonight . \\n is the mortal world finally starting to grow a conscious ? '' \\n os 'm ar scoffed . \\n `` yeah , and zeus will bless me with a new eye . \\n you 're ready to cash in ? '' \\n `` yeah . '' \\n i reached in my jacket and removed the box that housed the soul . \\n i slid it across the counter to os 'm ar . \\n `` give me a second . '' \\n os 'm ar disappeared in the door behind the bar as i took it upon myself to refill my liquid . \\n as i drunk from the clay cup , an arm roped itself around my neck . \\n i did n't bother to be alarmed because i already knew who it was . \\n `` aristaeus , were you really going to ignore me ? \\n you know how i get when you ignore me . '' \\n placing my cup on the bar , i turned to stare at lilith . \\n lilith was one of the most beautiful creatures of the damned i 'd seen . \\n i use to wonder what she did to find herself outcast , but then decided it did n't matter . \\n i had once thought myself to be in love with her , until i discovered she was true to her species . \\n `` you were entertaining guests . \\n i know how you get when you 're interrupted . '' \\n i said removing her hands from around me . \\n i picked my cup and continued to drain the contents from it as lilith plopped down on the stool beside me . \\n `` you 're the only male damned i 've seen that can stomach kampe blood . '' \\n `` do n't i feel special ? '' \\n `` come now aristaeus , this cold act of yours does n't fit you . \\n stay the night with me . '' \\n os 'm ar arrived back at the bar just in time to save me from executing a succubus . \\n `` here you go aristaeus . \\n two million dragon scales . '' \\n i took the purple bag filled with dragon scales from os 'm ar and stood up from my stool . \\n `` i 'll be back next week . '' \\n os 'm ar nodded as lilith jumped up clasping her hands around my arm . \\n `` aristaeus , please stay . \\n my next set is about to start , you ca n't miss that . '' \\n `` actually , i can . '' \\n i said shaking her hand off of me . \\n `` i have an obligation to fill back in pearu , a place my dear you 're no longer welcome to . '' \\n lilith stared at me in outrage as i brushed past her heading towards the round door located at the back of the bar . \\n i placed my hand on the scanner as a gold skeleton hand emerged from up the back of the scanner . \\n it clutched my hand as the red light move forward scanning my handprint before flashing green . \\n the round door let out a creak as it slid backwards revealing the entrance into my world . \\n the hand disappeared back in its hiding spot as i stepped through the doors the faint sounds of yearning sighs at my back . \\n the door locked back with a bang as i stared forward at the world of pearu . \\n two when it comes to describing the world of hell , most mortals instantly picture a place engulfed in flames with cavern rock bridges surrounded by lakes made of fire . \\n they think of hell as a place underground where torture goes on constantly with lucifer perched on a throne of skulls watching the evil beneath them . \\n it was an imaginary punishment they created to keep their kind in line , and it was an imaginary punishment we let remain . \\n if mortals were to see the world that awaited the damned souls , they would n't think twice about the sins that they commit . \\n the world of pearu was just that -- a world . \\n like earth , our world was divided up into continents and made up of land and water . \\n but where mortals had destroyed the land they were given , ours were the same as the day we first arrived . \\n the world pearu was like one big island . \\n our grass was a deep green and our soil was always rich enough to harvest . \\n our icy blue lakes were filled with bountiful sea creatures that often created some of the best stews and soups . \\n trees stood tall , their leaves brushing the outer line of the purple sky . \\n there was no moon or sun to tell us when the days had switched . \\n our lives were lived by the king . \\n when king kavos awakened , the world of pearu awakened . \\n when he slept , we slept . \\n the closing of the door grabbed a few pearuer 's attention as they moved about the city part of pearu . \\n i returned their stares as i made my way down the stone road near the different buildings filled with shops , restaurants , and other things . \\n behind me a white carriage pulled by a ladon , followed before coming to a stop in front of me . \\n coming to a stop , i turned my attention to the two creatures exiting the front of the car . \\n they were demons , and by the color of purple they wore in their jackets , they were king kavos men . \\n one of the demons stepped forward a grimace on his face . \\n i felt a smile tug at my lips as the sudden memory of who he was came to me . \\n his name was broxton . \\n last month i had the pleasure of defeating him in front of the king he so desperately worshipped and the members of the courant . \\n while it was just a harmless game to me , it appeared it was n't for broxton . \\n the defeat surely had knocked him down the ladder until he was nothing more than a minion . \\n `` aristaeus , king kavos would like to have a word with you . '' \\n i felt a bit of annoyance at the fact the king constantly kept tabs on when i entered and exited pearu . \\n `` please inform king kavos that i have not been home in weeks . \\n i would like to enjoy pearu and meet with old friends . \\n i will bless him with my presence tomorrow . '' \\n with that being said , i stepped around them . \\n `` the king told us to use force if necessary . '' \\n i chuckled as i turned to face them . \\n `` ah , so it is a death wish that you are after . \\n well i do n't want you two to think i 'm not obliging . '' \\n the demon behind broxton backed up the fear seeping from his pores , so that just left broxton . \\n broxton cut his eyes at the demon behind him no doubt reminding him of the little bit of command he had . \\n that was all it took to change my mind . \\n `` fine , you got me . \\n i have n't seen the king in a while , this will be fun '' i slid into the carriage as the terrified demon and broxton slid into the seat in front of me . \\n the carriage rolled smoothly down the road until we were could no longer see the buildings of the city . \\n the country stretched out in front of us as i stared out the window at the purple sky . \\n we took a left turn at the crossroads that would have led to my home . \\n `` he is at the arena . \\n why ? '' \\n `` king kavos and the courant want to be entertained . '' \\n broxton replied . \\n i sighed in disgust as i leaned back into the plush black seats . \\n even from the enclosed space of the carriage , i could hear the murderous cheers of the crowd . \\n the carriage pulled into the lot stopping at the back entrance of the arena . \\n i took a second to get myself together before stepping out of the carriage . \\n broxton and his whipped dog led me inside to the blue steel elevators that awaited us . \\n i stepped in behind them facing the wall , the elevator doors at my back . \\n the doors closed taking us to the balcony . \\n we stood there for no longer than three seconds before the doors in front of us opened . \\n the two demons stepped out and moved to the side as i made my way past them brushing broxton shoulder as i did . \\n i followed the cheering of the crowd and purple carpet until i came to the opening of the balcony . \\n king kavos guards immediately tensed , but at the sight of me they relaxed -- only a fraction . \\n when it comes to aging in the world of pearu , we did n't . \\n years in pearu cut off at age twenty one making us look as if we were in a world of teenagers . \\n only the king and members of the courant were allowed to walk around in their mortal faces while creatures of pearu wore their true faces . \\n the reason why -- they were demons . \\n demons ruled the world of pearu while all other creatures of the damned live to serve them . \\n however , king kavos and the members of the courant were hell demons . \\n in other words , they were our world 's elite . \\n king kavos wife stood up from her seat and made her way over to me . \\n kiowa was one hundred and thirty years old , but resembled a mortal fourteen year old . \\n her hair was the purple color of the sky as it fell into curly ringlets around her face down to her shoulders . \\n her shattered eyes had a blue tint to them and the lipstick she wore was of a light blue shade . \\n the strapless dress she wore was of the king 's colors while the tights up under it were pink a blue stripe running down the sides . \\n on her feet she wore a pair of boots , the strings made of purple dragon hair . \\n `` aristaeus , you 've finally returned . '' \\n she pulled me into a tight hug holding me as if she was afraid i would disappear again . \\n i simply patted her back . \\n i knew she worried about me , and for that i was sorry . \\n `` how have you been ? '' \\n `` i 've been okay . \\n my garden of berry lilies has bloomed . \\n they were just honeys the last time you 'd seen them . \\n if you 're not so busy , maybe you can them a pay visit . \\n they miss your voice . '' \\n `` i will . '' \\n kiowa smiled brightly at me grasping my hand . \\n she finally let go and made her way back to her seat next to king kavos . \\n standing there , i stared at the back of king kavos head before finally making my way to the seat on the right of them . \\n king kavos snapped his finger as a servant rushed forward to fill my empty glass full of clear liquid that came from the tears of a fox . \\n i brought the cup up to my lips and sipped slowly . \\n staring out across the railing of the balcony , i looked down into the pit of the arena as the battle between a centaur and a harpy took place . \\n the harpy seemed to be taking a beating from the centaur but it did not give up . \\n `` that color does n't seem to agree with you . '' \\n i glanced away from the fight and turned my attention to king kavos . \\n while kiowa was in her hundreds , king kavos was far older . \\n no one knew his true age , only that he 'd once served with the dethroned queen of pearu , eris . \\n `` hmm , that 's funny . \\n a mortal once told me that i looked quite smashing in this color . \\n maybe you 've lost your sight for fashion , or just maybe you 've lost your sight . '' \\n king kavos stared at me with his youthful face ; however the glare was anything but innocent . \\n king kavos had an oval shaped face that was framed by his black hair that lay bone straight down past his shoulders . \\n like me , he wore a cotton blazer jacket but his was purple . \\n a white bloused peeked through his top button as it traveled up making a tight puffy collar at his neck . \\n around the collar was a black tie with the pearu crest of a snake wrapped around a heart . \\n his hands sat entwined in his lap , a black moonstone ring on his hand as his long silver claw shaped nails gleamed . \\n his purple eyebrows were narrowed in a form i 'd come to recognize in my sleep as purple shattered eyes stared at me . \\n `` change before entering the streets of pearu . '' \\n he said turning back towards the fight . \\n `` as you wish , your highness . '' \\n `` there will be a feast at the palace tonight . \\n make sure to be in appearance . '' \\n `` as you wish , your highness . '' \\n `` do no leave the world of pearu again . '' \\n `` that is one wish the genie can not grant your highness . '' \\n king kavos turned his eyes back towards me a hint of a dangerous smile around his lips . \\n `` are you disobeying me ? '' \\n `` yes . '' \\n i said staring back defiantly . \\n the servants and guards moved nervously behind us as kiowa glanced over at us . \\n they could all feel the bubble trembling as the pin poked at it . \\n all it took was one more poke for the bubble to burst and everyone in its reach to be covered in its ire . \\n luckily , king kavos only chuckled . \\n the centaur picked up the harpy tossing it into the stone wall of the arena . \\n the crowd let out a cheer as the harpy slugged down the wall . \\n the centaur threw up his hands riling up the crowd more than they already were . \\n he was so focused on the crowd that he did not notice the harpy moving quickly towards him until it was too late . \\n the harpy latched on to the centaur 's neck ripping it completely off its body . \\n king kavos leaped up from his seat as his hands gripped the balcony . \\n he stared over the railing into the pit as his true face came forward reveling in the murderous scene . \\n patches of scales covered his face as his eyes pushed back further in his head . \\n his lizard split tongue flipped out his mouth tasting the air that was now filled with death . \\n his face transformed back as he sat down back in his chair . \\n `` i have duties to fulfill . '' \\n i spoke . \\n `` you have duties here aristaeus , or did you forget that while learning slang language from those apes . '' \\n `` are we done ? \\n i 'd like to unwind . '' \\n i said ignoring the jab . \\n king kavos suddenly stood up grabbing the dragon horn off its hook . \\n he blew into the horn as a loud blaring echoed silencing the whole arena . \\n once he had their attention he returned the horn to its spot . \\n raising his hands he said , `` creatures of pearu , it gives me great pleasure to announce that the great aristaeus has returned and has challenged troedh to a match to the death . '' \\n the crowd roared with cheer as the chanted between my name and troedh . \\n i felt my fingers tighten into a fist as king kavos returned to his seat . \\n `` they are waiting for you aristaeus . '' \\n kiowa stared at me with worried eyes as king kavos sipped from his cup , a smile on his lips . \\n standing up from my seat , without looking back , i made my way over to the stairs that led down into the pit of the arena . \\n as i descended the steps , creatures of all kinds leaned over the railing raising their fists in support or anger at me . \\n coming to a stop at the bottom of the steps , i removed my demos and jugest . \\n i unbuttoned the blazer i wore and tossed it behind me . \\n feminine screams erupted then and i made my way across the floor of the arena where troedh the ten foot giant awaited me . \\n i came to a stop in front of him as he stared down at me . \\n his lips spread into a smile showcasing his rock formed teeth that appeared to be covered in the remains of whatever he 'd eaten . \\n troedh wasted no time swatting at me as i smoothly dodged it . \\n his other arm came towards me with enough wind to create a tornado . \\n i leaped out of its way but the hook of it caught me on my feet sending me face first into the ground . \\n blood filled my mouth as i pushed myself up . \\n troedh caught me on my head as i stood knocking me back to the ground . \\n the crowd continued to taunt and cheer as i wondered for a second if i should just lay here and let him kill me . \\n it would serve the king right for putting me in this predicament , but it would also hurt kiowa . \\n with that thought in mind , i pushed up from the ground dodging another blow sent by troedh . \\n i leaped onto his arm that served the punch and ran up it . \\n troedh glanced around reaching for me , but i 'd rounded behind his head . \\n climbing up on his head , i reached down and dug my hands in his eyes as he let out a loud scream . \\n troedh hands flew up to his eyes as he cried , his feet stomping the ground sending it into small tremors of an earthquake . \\n i slid down his back making sure to clench my claw nails into his back . \\n the pain filled scream stirred the crowd as they shouted for more bloodshed . \\n i landed on my feet tucking back into a roll to avoid troedh who was now swinging wildly at the loss of his sight . \\n i grew tired of this game and decided to end it quickly . \\n i ran towards the giant in full speed feeling the kicks of my demon power surge through my body . \\n leaping off the ground , i flew up towards troedh 's head latching on to his neck . \\n our bodies cascaded downward as i carried the majority of his weight before shoving him upward towards the hanging spikes on the ceiling . \\n the spikes cut all the way through the giant 's body as troedh 's eyes enlarged . \\n slowly , his body slid off the spikes hurling down towards the floor of the arena . \\n he landed with a loud boom and lay there unable to move . \\n walking over to my items i 'd tossed aside earlier , i picked up my demos . \\n the crowd chanted my name as i walked back over to troedh , the demos gripped tightly in my hand . \\n i came to a stop in front of troedh 's head as i stared down at the now battered giant . \\n he knew what was coming and he did n't bother to fight it . \\n he knew the rules of the arena . \\n only one can leave alive . \\n the crowd gasped at the sight of the demos as i removed it from its cover . \\n the sword glowed blue , the silver winged handle clutched in my hand . \\n `` the gods have dealt you a bad hand this life my friend . \\n they owe you . '' \\n troedh let out a gargled laugh as my sword slashed cleanly through the air , his head rolling off to the side . \\n the crowd jumped up to their feet shouting and pumping their hands in the air . \\n `` aristaeus ! \\n aristaeus ! \\n long live the great aristaeus ! '' \\n i turned away from troedh 's body as the cleaning crew ran over to destroy his body . \\n my sword dragged through the dirt as i came to a stop under the balcony where i 'd been sitting earlier . \\n glancing up , i stared into the shattered eyes of king kavos as he leaned over the balcony staring down at me . \\n `` now we 're done . '' \\n i felt my hand tremble as i wanted nothing more than to thrust the sword up until it was embedded into his head , but i simply nodded . \\n i went to take a step but his voice stopped me . \\n `` aristaeus . \\n let this be a lesson to you . \\n i will not take defiance from anyone , even you . \\n do you understand ? '' \\n i swallowed tightly as the servants and guards stared down at me . \\n broxton had a smile on his face no doubt happy to see me being put in my place . \\n it was only because kiowa that i did not cause a scene . \\n `` aristaeus ! '' \\n `` yes father . \\n i understand . '' \\n king kavos smiled with satisfaction . \\n `` now , change those colors . \\n they do not suit you . '' \\n cold water rushed over my body as i leaned my head against the gold shower wall . \\n i raised a hand to push my hair back out of my face and stepped further up under the nozzle . \\n i could still smell the blood of troedh on me , even though i had bathed with some of kiowa 's pumpkin cleanser . \\n i finally had enough of the shower and stepped back from up under the nozzle , pushing the glowing water drop button to shut it off . \\n the minute i stepped out of the shower , the room heat dried me of any water drops . \\n i pulled on a pair of black pants that were laid out on the counter and opened the bathroom door . \\n kiowa was there in my room when i exited the bathroom . \\n she was no longer dressed in her outfit from earlier , and instead she wore a gold halter gown that fell to the floor . \\n claws from different beasts were sewed to the back ends of her dress clawing at the floor every time she walked . \\n her purple hair had been straightened and she 'd even added the crest of pearu necklace around her neck , however the blue lipstick remained . \\n seeing me enter , she strode to me . \\n `` aristaeus are you okay . \\n please do not let your father upset you . \\n you know how he gets . '' \\n `` you do not have to excuse my father 's actions kiowa . \\n i know his temper and seeing how you do as well , you should leave before he finds you here comforting me . '' \\n kiowa scoffed . \\n `` i 'm your mother . \\n i may not have given birth to you , but i have raised you as if you were my own son . \\n i have the right to comfort you if i want . \\n kavos has no say in my concerns with you . '' \\n i released a chuckle as i sat down on the bench in front of my bed . \\n since the day i was able to walk , my father had pushed me aside to the opposite side of the palace . \\n it was only thanks to kiowa that i did n't die from loneliness . \\n while my father thought he would keep me happy by showering me with lavish gifts , kiowa actually spent time with me . \\n she knew my likes , my pains , my interests . \\n she shared stories with me and did n't hesitate to listen to mine . \\n when i came home , she was genuinely happy to see me whereas my father never showed much emotion unless he was yelling at me . \\n i had often thought it was the only way he could show his love for me , but i knew better than that . \\n love did not exist in pearu , especially not when it came to the king . \\n kiowa came up behind me and placed her hands on my shoulders , her purple nails moved back in forth in my peripheral . \\n `` i miss when you 're here aristaeus . \\n when you 're here the castle does n't seem so cold . '' \\n `` you live in a world full of damned creatures kiowa . \\n cold is our nature . '' \\n `` you know what i mean . '' \\n she fussed shoving my shoulders . \\n `` do not sass me . '' \\n i laughed placing my hand on hers . \\n `` i know what you mean mother . '' \\n kiowa got quiet and i knew she was fighting back tears . \\n she always did that whenever i called her mother . \\n if a mortal saw kiowa they would think she was unfit for this world . \\n at times like this she seemed like an angel in the midst of demons . \\n it was the other times that would probably change their mind . \\n `` you should get dressed . \\n your father is inviting a lot of guests over to show off the fact that you 're home . '' \\n `` i guess me killing troedh also worked wonders . '' \\n `` i still ca n't believe he threw you into the arena like that . \\n even i could see the exhaust coming from you . \\n he just makes me so upset sometimes . '' \\n `` do not worry . '' \\n i said standing up from the bench . \\n `` i 'll go to his little dinner parties and complete any task he sets before me . \\n in a week , i will leave and fulfill my other duties . '' \\n at that kiowa placed a hand to her mouth . \\n a worried look came to her face . \\n `` what is it ? '' \\n i asked . \\n `` i 'm just worried about you being in that mortal world . \\n you 're alone with no backup . \\n the gods might decide to hurt you . \\n they never really need a reason to strike one of us down . '' \\n `` the gods have rules to follow just like we do . \\n father signed the contract permitting me to reap souls and zeus approved . \\n they 're not going to go back on their word . '' \\n `` your father was an idiot to sign a contract with them . '' \\n kiowa said chewing on her bottom lip . \\n `` he is always trying to prove that he wants peace , but i know it 's all just an act . \\n i know it . \\n he 's just buying time until zeus allows the gates to reopen . \\n then he 'll make his move . '' \\n `` in that case , he 'll never make his move . \\n zeus will never reopen the gates . \\n it 's time for not only the people of pearu to get that through their heads , but father as well . '' \\n the ceremonial room of the palace was filled with the swank creatures of pearu as they twirled around the dance floor , their clothing creating a sea of purple . \\n kiowa was off to the side of the room , a glass of amber liquid in her hands as she entertained a group of dryads . \\n my father sat on the throne at the front of the room his eyes constantly surveying the floor . \\n i on the other hand , was nursing my third glass of fox tears and hoping for a chance to escape . \\n every time i found an outing , my father eyes would land on me freezing me into place . \\n my teeth had gritted so much that they had pierced my tongue . \\n i tried to practice patience as i stood listening to a group of harpy 's compliment me on today 's fight . \\n just a couple of more days and i was out of here . \\n `` so aristaeus , i 've noticed you have n't chosen a bride yet . \\n my daughter ilia has just turned twenty one . \\n you should see her . \\n our people have given her the title of queen magnificence . \\n she was featured in the newspaper last week , you do get the papers when you return home do n't you . \\n i swear young lord , she is a beauty . '' \\n i turned my attention to the creature in front of me . \\n i never liked prince famar . \\n he was ruler of the second continent of our land , mayur , and he was a cheap . \\n the creatures of his land suffered from poverty while he and his courants lived the lifestyle of the rich . \\n upon a visit there last year , a baby chimera had attacked me . \\n it was only after i 'd went on defense that i 'd notice he was trying to steal the stew i had brought along with me on my trip . \\n i 'd given him the stew without second thoughts and offered him the other bibles i had on me . \\n as he scarfed down on the loaf of bread , he filled me in on his life and how prince famar had jailed his mother for missing a payment on her taxes . \\n the jailers had beaten her so fiercely that they killed her leaving the baby chimera alone . \\n famar had insisted the boy get a job doing odd errands until he could pay back the debt his mother owed , but instead he 'd ran away . \\n i had spoken to father about this but he simply pushed it away . \\n he already knew about the happenings in mayur and claimed he would deal with prince famar in due time . \\n however , as famar stood in front of me raving about his daughter that i 'm sure was an exact copy of him , i could tell that time had not yet come . \\n `` so , young lord what do you say ? '' \\n `` about what . '' \\n `` my daughter , ilia . \\n i can arrange a car to pick you up so the two of you can meet . '' \\n `` that wo n't be necessary . '' \\n i said draining the contents of my glass . \\n `` why is that young lord ? \\n have you chosen a bride ? '' \\n `` no , i just do n't involve myself with the trash of mayur that called themselves royals . '' \\n prince famar stepped back in shock as some guests whom overheard let out gasps . \\n `` if you 'll excuse me . '' \\n i brushed past prince famar and headed across the room far away . \\n i did n't dare steal a glance in my father 's direction . \\n if he had n't taken in the scene then i was positive someone was informing him of what happened right now . \\n he would not lose his temper in public , but i would pay dearly in private . \\n `` aristaeus . '' \\n i turned expecting to see famar wanting a rematch but instead i seen someone i was happy to see . \\n `` dyos , my good friend . '' \\n the two of us shared a friendly hug as i stepped back . \\n `` i was afraid you would n't show . '' \\n `` you know i would n't leave you to suffer in boredom . '' \\n dyos and i had grown up together inside and outside the walls of the palace . \\n thanks to his father being the general of pearu , he often brought dyos along whenever he came on business at the palace . \\n the two of us would often cause problems for the court servants and then sneak out into the world of pearu to cause problems there . \\n once dyos and i had become the age to travel alone without parents , we would meet up and head out on days of adventure only returning in the wee bit of the morning . \\n we would be tired by the time we got home especially seeing how we could n't go to bed until later that night , but it was worth it . \\n `` what kept you this time ? '' \\n dyos threw a hand over my shoulder . \\n `` my friend , i ran into a group of sirens and they are looking to party . \\n the leader is cute and red head just like you like them . '' \\n `` tempting , but i will have to pass on a night in pearu . '' \\n `` ah , come on aristaeus . \\n do not do this to me . \\n you 've been gone for two weeks leaving me to hang with a group of minotaur 's . \\n minotaur 's aristaeus ! \\n they do n't know how to party . \\n you could have at least offered to take me to the mortal world with you . '' \\n `` and how exactly would i explain you to the gods when they descend and ask for the reason of you being in the mortal world . '' \\n `` um , i 'm your apprentice . '' \\n i laughed as i stared over at my father who was sharing a word with kiowa . \\n `` so , what is the real reason that you ca n't hang with me tonight ? '' \\n `` i need to stick close to home for a couple of days . \\n the king is a bit irate with me . \\n i need to get back into his good graces if not for me , but kiowa 's sake . '' \\n `` ah , do n't worry about that my friend . \\n he 's probably just up in arms about the recent sighting of eris . '' \\n my head snapped towards dyos . \\n `` someone sighted eris . \\n are you sure ? '' \\n `` well it was n't exactly eris , but the rogues . \\n it was all the courants could talk about . \\n i overheard my father speaking about it to my mother a week ago . '' \\n `` where were they spotted ? \\n who was the witness ? '' \\n `` from what i can tell they were spotted near the outskirts of mayur . \\n i do n't know too much about the witness . \\n they 're keeping whoever it is in secrecy . \\n i can tell you this though . '' \\n dyos said stepping closer to me , his voice dropping in a whisper . \\n `` the night they were spotted , someone tried to break into the prince famar 's palace and later on that night they found someone dead . '' \\n `` who ? '' \\n `` i do n't know that either my friend . \\n all i could tell that it was n't someone of much importance . \\n maybe just a resident of mayur . '' \\n i opened my mouth to ask dyos another question when broxton appeared next to me . \\n `` the king wishes to speak with you in private . '' \\n `` i 'm with a guest right now . '' \\n i said turning my back to broxton ready to start the conversation back up with dyos . \\n `` it 's of importance . '' \\n `` it 's always of importance . '' \\n broxton frowned as dyos stared between us . \\n `` aristaeus , go speak with your father . \\n i 'm going to head out anyway . \\n those sirens are waiting and you know i 'm never one to leave them to sing alone . '' \\n dyos patted my shoulder and turned disappearing into the crowd . \\n i turned back to broxton and threw out a hand . \\n `` lead the way kind sir . '' \\n broxton led me through the crowd of partygoers and past the throne . \\n kiowa gave me a worried glance standing from her seat as i shook my head and disappeared through the doors . \\n i followed broxton down the hall until we reached the set of double doors being watched but he guards . \\n broxton stepped a few feet away from the guards as i made my way past them . \\n wrapping my hand around the handle , i opened the door and stepped through closing it softly behind me . \\n my father stood across the room with his back to me as he stared out the window into the land of pearu . \\n `` you wished to speak with me . '' \\n my father turned around to face me . \\n his eyes held anger in them . \\n `` leave pearu tomorrow . '' \\n i blinked , thinking i 'd heard him unclearly . \\n `` what did you say ? '' \\n `` you heard me aristaeus . '' \\n `` i heard you , i do just not understand . \\n you 've been giving me crap about remaining home , and now you want me to leave . '' \\n `` i do not have to explain my actions to you . '' \\n my father said putting his arms behind his back . \\n `` i am the king here , not you . '' \\n `` well as king , you shall inform me the reason for me being banned . '' \\n `` do not be silly aristaeus . \\n i am not banning you from pearu . \\n i am just sending you on an early vacation . \\n you were planning on leaving next week anyhow , am i right ? '' \\n `` that 's beside the point . '' \\n i said feeling my voice raise . \\n `` is this because of the rumor i heard tonight ? '' \\n `` i would n't know what rumors you have heard tonight . '' \\n `` cute is not your forte father . \\n i 'm talking about the rogues being sighted in this world . '' \\n `` of course they would be in this world , what other world would they go to ? \\n they are creatures of the damned . \\n do you think they are living freely among the mortals or care free with the gods ? '' \\n `` i do n't care where they 're shacking up at . \\n i care about their sudden appearance and what it 's doing to you . \\n they 've only been spotted once and already there 's trouble . '' \\n my father walked off from me back towards the window as i went on . \\n `` we ca n't let the rogues lead this world into destruction like eris once tried before . \\n the gods will not be so forgiving this time . \\n we need to contact them and let them know -- '' `` we will not contact the gods !! '' \\n my father roared his true face coming forward . \\n `` you will leave this matter to the courant and i and you will leave this world first thing in the morning . '' \\n `` but father ! '' \\n `` that is an order aristaeus ! '' \\n three the next morning i found myself staring out my bedroom window . \\n last night had been rough on me that i 'd tossed and turned all through the night barely getting a lick of sleep . \\n the argument with my father was as fresh on my mind as it was when i 'd left his quarters . \\n i still could n't accept the fact that he was banning me from pearu , even if it was for a little while . \\n kiowa , had been outside the door listening to our argument , but at the words of my father ordering banishment , she 'd busted through the doors . \\n she yelled , cried , and fought my father who simply pushed her away . \\n at the end neither of us could change his mind . \\n kiowa had run from the room in tears which struck up another argument with my father . \\n my father had had enough as he snapped his fingers and the guards entered . \\n i had taken out ten of them before they finally gained enough strength to remove me from the room . \\n a knock sounded at my door and i instantly tensed . \\n father had announced that a carriage would be arriving today to take me to the gates of pearu . \\n morning had just started and he was already trying to get rid of me . \\n `` go away ! '' \\n i called in anger . \\n the door came open and a tiny figure entered . \\n it was one of my mother 's maids gilda that often stayed at her side . \\n `` i 'm sorry to bother you young lord , but breakfast is ready . '' \\n `` i 'm not hungry . '' \\n i said turning back around to face the window and stare out at the ocean . \\n `` but the king - '' `` do not speak of the king to me !! '' \\n gilda stepped back terrified as i willed myself to calm down . \\n `` i am sorry . \\n i did not mean to frighten to you . \\n tell the king that i will not be down to eat . '' \\n `` your young lord , may i please ask a favor ? '' \\n i turned to face her as she moved around uneasily . \\n she never really said more than a few words to me during my encounter , and now she was asking me for a favor . \\n i knew it had to be one of importance to her . \\n i nodded giving her the go ahead . \\n `` young lord , the favor that i ask is that you go down for breakfast . \\n queen kiowa is at the table alone with the king . \\n she barely slept last night due to the argument that happened between her and the king . \\n she 's been building up with anger and i feel she may release it on the king if you are not there to calm her . \\n i am afraid on how the king will retaliate if she shows rudeness to him . '' \\n i took in what she said and i could understand her concern . \\n my father was not one to tolerate rudeness even if it came from the love of his life . \\n `` fine , i will be down shortly . '' \\n gilda nodded and then back stepped out of the room closing the door . \\n i released a sigh as i turned back to stare out at a view that i would n't be seeing for a while . \\n i remained there for a couple of more minutes before finally getting dressed to head downstairs . \\n i entered the dining hall and immediately noticed the tension . \\n kiowa sat at the left end of the table eating while throwing eye daggers down the table at my father who ignored them . \\n i walked over to kiowa 's side of the table and took a seat next to her . \\n the sight of me had taken some of the anger out of her as she stared at me , her shadowed eyes the color of yellow today . \\n her hair was back in ringlets as the purple gleamed in the chandelier light . \\n she reached out and grasped my hand giving it a squeeze to say `` thank you . '' \\n the servants flocked to the table filling my cup full of berry juice and placing a hot bowl of gooey pink porridge in front of me . \\n they cut two slices of meat from the lion on the table and placed it on a platter next to the stew . \\n i grabbed a piece of the meat and rolled it before stuffing it into my mouth . \\n kiowa laughed as my father scoffed . \\n i had succeed in bringing the light back into her eyes while disgusting my father . \\n `` you really should n't eat like that aristaeus . \\n it will ruin your chances to marry . '' \\n `` come on now kiowa , most of the ladies of pearu eat like me . \\n well , all except you . '' \\n kiowa swatted my arm as she sipped from her spoon . \\n `` have you packed ? ' \\n my father spoke ruining the serene mood . \\n `` once you leave , you will not be able to return back until i call for you . '' \\n `` i will not be taking anything from here with me so there is no need to pack . '' \\n `` nonsense , you still have to represent the kingdom even outside the gates . '' \\n i chuckled leaning back in my seat . \\n my father had never been outside the gates without his entourage . \\n if he were found outside the gates alone sporting the kingdom colors , the outcasts would have made a game out of him . \\n `` i take it zeus agreed to my extended stay outside the gates . '' \\n `` of course he did . \\n why would n't he ? \\n you will be working for him by reaping souls . '' \\n my father reached for his glass sipping the cool liquid before placing the glass back down . \\n `` you shall not be in the mortal world other than that . \\n i do not want to have any problems with those righteous brutes . \\n i just need you to stay put until i can negotiate a new contract with them . '' \\n `` and in this contract , are you negotiating our freedom to roam the mortal world . '' \\n `` what i negotiate is none of your concern . '' \\n `` i take that as a yes . '' \\n i said . \\n `` do you really think that zeus will allow those of the damned to roam the mortal world especially when the rogues have been spotted recently ? '' \\n my father stared daggers at me . \\n `` ah . \\n you have not alerted him of her presence even though it 's your duty as king to do so . '' \\n `` the gods do not need to worry . \\n eris is of this world so i will handle her rogues . '' \\n `` handle them ? \\n is that what you 're calling hiding away in the palace while they causes havoc . '' \\n `` aristaeus ! '' \\n kiowa called . \\n `` now , that is enough . '' \\n `` no , kiowa . '' \\n my father said raising a hand to silence her . \\n `` aristaeus is right . \\n i am hiding away while she creates havoc . '' \\n my father turned his eyes to me . \\n `` if aristaeus was king he would have no doubt called the army and set out after the rogues getting himself killed and this world destroyed . \\n eris not a typical creature of the damned . \\n she is the first and she is the most powerful . \\n she has kept this world running for centuries and she has kept herself hidden even from the great zeus . \\n the rogues are carbon copies of her . \\n they is do not rush in without a reason . \\n they are after something far greater than a few measly deaths of some servants . \\n but obviously aristaeus already knows this despite he has never met or seen eris in his life while i on the other hand have worked , ate , and slept alongside her . '' \\n the room grew quiet as i stared down into my now lukewarm stew . \\n i hated to admit it , but my father was right . \\n i had no clue how eris looked or even the remote clue on how she and the rogues operated . \\n i would have ended up doing everything my father said and ended up getting killed . \\n `` this is why you 're not ready for the throne yet . \\n you 're young and you still act without thinking everything through not realizing the trouble you leave in your midst . \\n that is why i am sending you away . '' \\n my father pushed away his chair away from the table and stood up . \\n `` the chariot should arrive shortly . \\n i have a meeting to attend to so i will not be able to see you off . '' \\n `` i will go with him . '' \\n `` you will do no such thing kiowa . '' \\n `` that is not your decision kavos . '' \\n kiowa spoke fiercely . \\n `` you are banishing my son out of pearu and the least i could do for him is see him to the gates since i could not sway the king on allowing him to remain home instead of a place of danger . '' \\n `` he is in no danger kiowa . '' \\n `` he will always be in danger as long as he 's outside those gates ! \\n the gods do not show favors to us even if you 're the king 's son . \\n they could strike him down at any minute out there and there would be nothing that we could do because we ca n't exit the gates without their permission . \\n so do not tell me i ca n't see my son off because you will lose that fight kavos . '' \\n my father stared across the table at kiowa as she held her ground . \\n finally he gave a wave of his hand . \\n `` do what you want kiowa . \\n i will not stop you . \\n but once you return to this palace you will not leave any more . \\n is that understood ? '' \\n `` yes , your highness . '' \\n my father gave us another glance before leaving the room . \\n i turned to face kiowa who was shaking . \\n i grasped her hand in mine as she gave me a weak smile . \\n `` you should n't have upset him . '' \\n `` you 're one to talk . '' \\n `` i can do that kiowa . \\n i 'm leaving here . \\n you 're the one who have to remain behind with him . '' \\n `` do not worry about your father . '' \\n she said patting my hand . \\n `` i can handle him . \\n let 's just finish our breakfast and then we 'll take a walk in the garden before your departure . '' \\n we ate breakfast in silence both of us worried about the other . \\n the carriage came to a stop outside the gates of pearu . \\n i stepped out of the carriage ignoring the hand of the demon from yesterday . \\n i reached out a hand to kiowa as she stepped out of the carriage behind me holding the end of her yellow gown in her hand . \\n the demon closed the carriage door and walked off giving us some time alone . \\n `` are you sure you did n't want me to ask the servants to pack you some meat ? \\n we 've just got in the best prime meats from the souk and there are scraps from breakfast . \\n you enjoyed the lion 's meat this morning did n't you ? \\n let 's go back and get you some . '' \\n kiowa rambled while dragging me back towards the carriage . \\n `` mother stop it . \\n i do not need any scraps . \\n besides if i enter belham with prime meats , i 'll be robbed . '' \\n `` more the reason for you not to go . \\n i have some friends in the city that will hide you until your father finally comes back to his senses . '' \\n `` no need . '' \\n i said shaking my head . \\n my father was not going to come to his senses anytime soon . \\n `` i 'll be okay in belham . \\n everyone knows me , so there is no threat . \\n i 'll just do the jobs assigned for me and keep my head down . \\n you do the same as well . \\n you 've made it onto father 's bad side for a couple of days . \\n it 's best you stay to your garden . '' \\n i placed a kiss on kiowa 's forehead as she released tears . \\n i wiped a few of them away before turning and heading towards the gate . \\n `` aristaeus ! '' \\n stopping in my tracks , i turned to see dyos running towards me . \\n he ran past kiowa giving her a half bow before coming to stop in front of me . \\n `` sorry i 'm late . \\n the damn redhead siren i was with last night tried to take my soul while we were canoodling . \\n i think she forgot that i 'm not a mortal man and it took me forever to gain my strength back . \\n you were right to skip out on the date with them . '' \\n `` do i need to leave you with a babysitter while i 'm away ? '' \\n `` no i 'll be fine . \\n it 's you i 'm worried about . \\n has the king finally lost it ? \\n how can he banish his son ? \\n the least he could do is banish you off to another continent but an entire world . '' \\n `` look , do not worry about me . \\n i will be back in no time . '' \\n i said . \\n i glanced over at kiowa who was dabbing away at her eyes with her handkerchief . \\n `` just due me a favor . '' \\n `` anything . '' \\n `` keep an eye out for kiowa . \\n she made the mistake of getting on kavos bad side this morning . \\n he 's holding her hostage in the palace as soon as she returns , but i 'm pretty sure he has more in store for her disobedience . '' \\n `` no problem . \\n the old man has a meeting with him today . \\n i 'll just head over there and sneak off to your quarters . \\n he wo n't even know that i 'm there . '' \\n `` thanks man . '' \\n i gave him a pat on the shoulder and turned back in the direction of the gate . \\n i walked up to the gate that housed the round door that would take me to belham . \\n two guards stood on the outside armed and in the middle was the king 's secretary . \\n i came to a stop in front of them as the secretary stepped forward , a parchment in hand . \\n unrolling the parchment , he began to speak . \\n `` prince aristaeus priam , son of king kavos priam . \\n on this day of febvos 11th , year of priam -- you have been sentenced to partial banishment from the world of pearu by his highness king kavos priam . \\n the rules to your banishment are as follows : you will take accommodation in belham and complete all duties assigned to you by his highness . \\n you will not enter the world of mortals unless it pertains to your duties . \\n his highness will decide when your banishment is up , and only his highness can allow you back into the world of pearu . \\n prince aristaeus priam , this ends the reading of your banishment . \\n you may now enter belham . '' \\n the secretary stepped to the side as the guards rolled open the door . \\n i walked towards the doors as the image of belham slowly came together . \\n `` be careful aristaeus ! '' \\n dyos shouted at my back . \\n `` i 'll see you when you get home . \\n i 'll throw you a celebration . \\n i promise there wo n't be any sirens ! '' \\n the doors closed shutting off dyos voice as i was now in belham . \\n the barn smell of the bar surrounded me as i was once back in a place i 've grown to call home . \\n the bar was n't as full today since it was morning . \\n there was no band on stage playing and no succubus at the microphone . \\n i was very glad for the last one . \\n the last thing i need is a run in with lilith today . \\n os ' mar appeared from the door behind the bar and paused . \\n he stared at me with a look of pity as i made my way towards the bar . \\n without speaking , he went to fix me a drink as i plopped down on one of the barstools . \\n he slid the cup of kampe blood over to me as i threw it back and awaited another . \\n `` so you 've been banned huh ? '' \\n os ' mar said in his gruff voice as i tossed back the second cup . \\n `` so it appears . '' \\n `` what did you do to piss off the king ? '' \\n `` i was me . '' \\n i said smiling up at os ' mar. . \\n os ' mar let out a rough chuckle as he cleaned some imaginary dirt out of a glass . \\n `` well hell that 'll piss anyone off . '' \\n we both laughed . \\n i felt better already . \\n os ' mar had no clue that i was the king 's son and that 's the way i wanted to keep it . \\n if he knew , he might want to take revenge for the hand he was dealt . \\n so it was because of my request when i first entered this world , that my identity had remained hidden . \\n os ' mar thinks i 'm nothing more than another demon servant to the king and i let him think no less . \\n `` you have any jobs for me . '' \\n `` yeah , i 've got quite a few but none for today . \\n you 've been banished for pearu . \\n that 's a cause for celebration . \\n hey zumgrel , strike up the band ! '' \\n zumgrel had been snoring noisily at the piano , but at the sound of os ' mar 's voice he leaped up and started to wail on the piano . \\n it was n't long for those whom had been sleeping had ventured down into the bar ordering drinks , dancing , and fighting . \\n i spotted lilith making her way downstairs so i tossed the last drink i had down my throat and dived into the sea of fighting chimera . \\n california was one place i 'd hated more than any other in the mortal world . \\n i hated new york as well , but it was something about california that drove me crazy . \\n maybe it was because of the muggy heat . \\n pearu , though it was hell , did not experience this type of heat . \\n our weather was always cool despite the stories about hell being an inferno . \\n it was n't just the heat that bothered me here though -- it was also the fact that i could n't wear my normal clothes in this weather without alerting the mortals to the fact that i might be some sort of freak . \\n so here i was dressed in a pair of beach shorts and a tank . \\n my black hair was still pulled into a ponytail and i still kept my demos and jugest strapped on me . \\n though i was dressed in mortal clothing , i was still getting strange looks from traveling mortals . \\n however , there was nothing that i could do about that . \\n i 'd changed into their clothing but there was no way i was getting rid of my weapons . \\n they would just have to stare . \\n `` excuse me sir , do you need a taxi ? '' \\n i stared in front of me at the tan skinned man inside the yellow box shaped car . \\n his eyes moved nervously from the weapons on me as he tried to decide whether or not if it was a good idea to speak to me . \\n `` no , i do not need a ride anywhere . '' \\n the man jumped at the sound of my voice startled . \\n he gave me another glance before speeding off into the flow of traffic almost causing a car accident . \\n i made my way down the sidewalks of the rich society as mortals walked to and from carrying bags full of pricy clothing , briefcases , and food bags . \\n i made no eye contact as i headed towards a jewelry building that was surrounded by the mortal police and terrified mortals . \\n i pulled out my list and checked it . \\n this was the right place . \\n i tucked the list into my shirt and headed towards the doors . \\n `` hey ! \\n you ca n't go in there ! '' \\n i ignored the police officer and stepped toward the doors of the jewelry store . \\n i sighed . \\n i hated things like this . \\n i really did n't want to alert the mortals to the fact that i was n't mortal , but yet i had a schedule to keep to . \\n i would just pray the gods will do what they do best and make the mortals think they were seeing things . \\n it turns out they were watching me . \\n i stepped through the glass with no problems from the mortals . \\n in fact , they were looking around to see where i had disappeared to . \\n making my way through the jewelry store , i could hear the faint cries of the hostages . \\n coming to the room where they were being held , i peered around the corner and stared at the two gunmen who were pointing their shotguns at them . \\n the hostages quivered in the corner trying to protect each other . \\n this is where things being a reaper get tricky . \\n being in the world of the mortals , you sometimes found yourself getting attached . \\n and as a reaper , you see the many deaths these mortals face and sometimes want to help them . \\n but it is out of our hands . \\n gods and demons are not made to interfere with the lives of mortals . \\n gods may offer advice and companionship , but they can not woo mortals on a specific course . \\n it goes against the rules of their god . \\n so with that being said , i had no choice but to wait for the souls that will soon be exiting the realm of mortals and waiting in the balance . \\n it did n't take long . \\n one of the male hostages made a foolish but courageous move to take the gun and ended up getting himself shot . \\n the gunman was so thrown off that he did n't see the other two male hostages rushing him knocking him to the ground . \\n the gun went off again , this time killing the gunman as the police were making their way in . \\n the hostages ran from the room as i quickly entered unnoticed and stood over the body of the male hostage . \\n i could hear the boots of the mortal police as i called forward the soul of the hostage and then moved over to that of the gunman . \\n i placed the souls in my box just in time as the mortal police rounded the corner . \\n if they had been a second early they would have seen the ball of light exiting the dead bodies and i would have had some explaining to do to the gods . \\n as it were , i made my way pass them as i came in and back into the hot streets of california . \\n i arrived back in belham around nightfall . \\n the norjels went through their same routine before releasing me . \\n i walked into os ' mar 's bar and grabbed a seat at my usual stool . \\n os ' mar was in the corner talking on the telephone no doubt to the king . \\n i glanced around the room to see everyone , everyone but lilith . \\n looks like my night will be free of annoyance . \\n os ' mar hung up the receiver and made his way over to me . \\n there was a slight frown on his face and i instantly tensed . \\n had my father gone against my wishes and spoken of my true identity ? \\n no , i immediately answered that question . \\n my father would not want the creatures of pearu to know that he had banished his son . \\n his image would be ruined . \\n `` rough night ? '' \\n `` not rough , more like strange . '' \\n os ' mar answered . \\n `` come with me to the back . '' \\n i got off my stool and followed os ' mar behind the bar through the door . \\n the room was a small size of an office i have seen plenty of times in the mortal world . \\n in fact this room was made just in case mortals ever discovered belham . \\n os ' mar walked over to the desk and picked up the telephone . \\n he punched in a couple of numbers before placing it back on the handle . \\n the room made a groaning noise as the desk slowly moved over . \\n the floor tiles gave away creating a circle opening in the floor . \\n inside the whole was a spiral staircase that led further down into the opening . \\n os ' mar stepped down the stairs as i followed behind him , the opening closing and the desk sliding back into place . \\n gold lamps were attached to the wall as blue light illuminated from within them . \\n we came to the end of the steps to see a gold barred door . \\n os ' mar pushed the stone on the side of the door to the side as a scanner popped out . \\n the scanner was an exact copy to the one that got you into pearu . \\n the door opened and the scanner returned as we stepped through revealing os ' mar 's secret treasure room . \\n the room was of a shape of an octagon . \\n gold locked boxes covered two of the left walls and two of the right walls . \\n in the middle was another desk accompanied by two chairs and behind it on the wall was the vault . \\n `` you 've got the souls ? '' \\n `` yeah . '' \\n i said . \\n i reached into my jacket and removed the box handing it over to os ' mar. . \\n os ' mar waved to a seat as i plopped down . \\n i watch him walk over to one of the locked boxes , opening it and placing the box inside . \\n the gold box snapped shut and locked on its own . \\n os ' mar made his back across the room over to the vault . \\n the vault opened with a whoosh as the smell of dragon scales took over the room . \\n os ' mar removed a bag and filled it full of the teardrop shaped currency . \\n once it was full , he closed the vault back and headed over to the desk . \\n `` what do you plan to do with dragon scales in belham ? '' \\n he asked tossing the bag over to me and plopping down in a chair . \\n `` it ca n't be for the booze and lodging . \\n the king covers that for you . '' \\n `` this money goes to the king , only a small percent comes to me . '' \\n os ' mar scoffed . \\n `` you would think the king would give you more seeing you have to enter that filth of a mortal world . \\n you should ask for half . '' \\n `` i do not negotiate with the king over money . \\n money i have . '' \\n `` well will you please loan me some . \\n i could never have more than enough money . '' \\n `` and what would you spend it on ? \\n this is belham remember . '' \\n `` i would save it for when i returned to pearu . \\n false dreams i know , but one can hope . '' \\n os ' mar said . \\n `` maybe if i continue to do what the zeus orders , he will convince the king to let me return . '' \\n `` do you know what awaits you when you return ? \\n you would want to return to a world where you 're labored as a traitor ? '' \\n `` it will be hard . \\n i know that . \\n but the money i have made over here could guarantee me security and as long as i have you as a friend while over there , i could handle anything . '' \\n i nodded agreeing with his words . \\n he was right . \\n while the move would be a tough one at first , his money would guarantee him a spot at the elite which came with guards and an invitation into the king 's circle . \\n the thought of the king made me think about os ' mar 's phone call . \\n `` did you get a call from the king today ? \\n you looked a bit dismayed when i returned . '' \\n `` no not the king . \\n it was from an informant in pearu . \\n i have n't talked to him a while so the fact that he was calling proved that his information was worth knowing . '' \\n os ' mar paused as i waited for him to continue . \\n `` there is something big going down in pearu . \\n my informant tells me there has been quite a few strange deaths recently and that the king has left the court many times this week . '' \\n at that i sat up . \\n my father never left the court unless it was to the arena or a public event . \\n other than that , meetings were held at the palace . \\n `` what do you mean he left ? \\n what about the queen ? '' \\n `` the queen was n't with him . \\n the informant says she has n't left the palace at all . \\n she usually visits the town to convert with the citizens , but not as this week . \\n only the king and his army have left the palace . \\n there are rumors that he visited mayur and arwid . '' \\n `` how much do you trust this informant ? '' \\n i asked . \\n `` while i would n't trust him with my life -- i trust him when it comes to his information . \\n his information has saved my neck back in the day despite the betrayal he later dealt me . '' \\n i stared across at os ' mar. . \\n i could tell we were thinking the same thing . \\n something was developing in the world of pearu . \\n i entered my room that i 'd taken claim to the first time i arrived in belham . \\n i walked over to the phone that was in my room and picked up the receiver . \\n `` pearu to belham , where may i direct your call ? '' \\n `` get me the king 's palace . '' \\n i said . \\n `` i 'm sorry sir . \\n calls from belham can not be connected to the king 's palace . \\n would you like me to direct your call to the king 's secretary ? '' \\n `` this is prince aristaeus priam , \\u03b23721 # 49 . \\n get me the king 's palace now ! '' \\n `` yes your highness , i apologize . \\n routing you to the palace . '' \\n the line held for a moment before a familiar voice picked up the line . \\n `` aristaeus ! \\n is that you ? '' \\n `` yes mother it is me . \\n what are you doing picking up the line ? \\n where are the servants ? '' \\n `` i had them direct any calls from belham concerning you to my private line . \\n how are you ? \\n are you being treated well there ? '' \\n `` i 'm fine . '' \\n i said gripping the phone . \\n i could feel the waves of her worry coming through the line . \\n i missed her . \\n `` mother i must ask you something and you must be truthful with me . '' \\n kiowa got quiet on the line and i 'd thought she 'd disconnected . \\n `` kiowa ? '' \\n `` i 'm here . \\n go ahead aristaeus . \\n ask your question ? '' \\n `` what is going on over there , and do n't tell me nothing . \\n i know that father has left the palace and is traveling with an army to mayur and arwid . '' \\n `` honestly aristaeus , i do not know much . \\n only what the servants tell me . \\n they say more killings have been happening . \\n this time it is prince famar 's daughter . '' \\n `` ilia . '' \\n i said remembering her name from the conversation i had with the prince . \\n `` she is dead . '' \\n `` yes , as well as her court ladies . \\n they say eris is behind it and she 's been gathering her followers . \\n they say she wants a war aristaeus . '' \\n the thought of eris running loose through pearu killing royalty worried me . \\n mayur was the second biggest palace in pearu . \\n it was guarded heavily just like our palace . \\n if eris could get passed the guards into the palace to kill the crown princess , she could do the same to kiowa . \\n `` mother , listen to me . \\n i want you to find dyos and remain in my quarters . \\n i will find a way home . \\n do you understand me ? '' \\n there was no reply on the line . \\n `` mother ? \\n kiowa ! '' \\n `` the phones are out . '' \\n said a voice behind me . \\n i turned around to see lilith standing in my room . \\n i slowly placed the receiver back on its hook as i stared at her . \\n `` how did you get into this room ? \\n the door was locked . '' \\n `` i have the key . '' \\n the gold set of keys that belonged to os ' mar jingled in her hand as she smiled brightly at me . \\n `` who were you on the phone with ? '' \\n `` my business does not concern you . '' \\n `` ah , aristaeus . \\n do n't be like that . '' \\n she said walking up to me . \\n `` i was just worried since i 've heard the news about you no longer being welcomed in pearu . \\n must bite the big one . '' \\n `` does n't bother me much . \\n i 'll be heading back no time soon . '' \\n `` of course you will seeing how you 're the king 's son . '' \\n i tensed and stared at lilith . \\n how did she know that ? \\n she had to have been digging . \\n or could it be she 'd seen me once in pearu before she was banned . \\n `` by your quietness , i can tell that i am right which means i must be right about you calling home . \\n who was on the other line ? \\n the queen , kiowa . '' \\n `` what do you want from me ? '' \\n i asked . \\n lilith smiled . \\n `` what i 've always wanted , you . \\n for the two of us to marry and become rulers of our world . \\n the king and queen of pearu . '' \\n `` i hate to break the news to you sweetheart , but there is already a king and queen of pearu . '' \\n `` not for long . '' \\n the smile on her face was one of secrecy and i felt a sense of dread . \\n `` what do you mean ? '' \\n i asked grabbing her shoulders . \\n screams sounded downstairs taking my attention off of lilith . \\n i pushed her to the side as i ran out my room and stood on the balcony of my floor . \\n i stared down below in horror as the residents of the belham were being attacked by creatures of the damned that i 've never seen here before . \\n i withdrew my demos and was about to head down when lilith gripped my shoulders . \\n `` do not get involved aristaeus . \\n in time , this will all be over . '' \\n i shoved her hands off of me and turned to face her . \\n `` what have you done ? '' \\n `` i 've done what i had to do for us . \\n the time has come for a new era and she has promised to grant us any land that we want . \\n the two of can rule as king and queen . '' \\n i stared at lilith as it all came together . \\n `` you 're one of her supporters . \\n you 're working for eris . \\n how can you betray your king ? '' \\n `` he is not my king . \\n kavos has grown weak while eris has seen the future . \\n she does n't bow down to these gods like kavos does . \\n she is powerful . \\n more powerful than any of us could have imagined . '' \\n i was tired of hearing her nonsense . \\n i turned away from her to make my way down the stairs . \\n `` i have broken the gates aristaeus ! '' \\n i paused on the step and turned to face her . \\n `` what ? \\n what did you say ? '' \\n lilith smiled . \\n `` the gates to pearu have been broken . \\n the creatures of the damned are free to roam into the mortal world . '' \\n i stared at lilith as she stared back her features changing into something far more evil that i 've ever seen . \\n `` you have no idea , what you 've done . '' \\n her smile dropped as i headed down the stairs . \\n as my foot hit the bottom step , loud thunder sounded . \\n flashes of light came from the sky as everyone started to scatter . \\n some ran back towards the gates of pearu while others escaped through the veil to the mortal world . \\n lightning struck again as four figures entered through the doors that led to pearu . \\n years of childhood fear went through me as i stared at the figures dressed in gold armor . \\n one of them stepped forward conveying a symbol i knew in my sleep . \\n it was the symbol that identified the gods . \\n as the god 's eyes scanned the room , he clutched a sword the shape of a lightning bolt in his hand . \\n it was then i felt my breath catch . \\n it was n't just any god . \\n it was zeus . \\n four at the sight of the gods standing in the bar , the creatures of the damned that remained instantly ran for the exits . \\n the gods that stood behind zeus race past him after the escapees . \\n i glanced back up the stairs to see that lilith had disappeared already as well . \\n since the gods had yet to spot me , i backed up behind the corner and made my way to the back door that os ' mar kept hidden from the other residents . \\n it was one that led out into the field away from the norjels . \\n i had no clue where os ' mar had disappeared to or if he knew that the gods would be coming here tonight . \\n i could n't search for him . \\n i had to leave , but where to . \\n there was no way that i could return through the gates of pearu tonight . \\n not with the gods standing in front of it . \\n i had no choice but to enter the mortal world . \\n but how long can i remain hidden before they detected me . \\n i pushed open the back door and headed out into the fields . \\n the grass of the field was broken from where someone had trampled through . \\n the damage look to be of one recent and i knew that it was lilith who came through here . \\n the thought lilith made me grit my teeth . \\n she was the one who 'd done this . \\n she 'd led fellow outcasts to their death and brought the gods wrath down upon us . \\n but why ? \\n why would lilith have the outcasts killed ? \\n did they know something important ? \\n is that why she killed them ? \\n those in the bar were either criminals or betrayers . \\n creatures that the king did not find worthy of meeting the blade of his sword . \\n they were no one important , so why kill them ? \\n i came to a stop at the end of the trampled grass and glanced around . \\n lilith 's tracks stopped here . \\n there was nothing but fields and a forest ahead . \\n she could n't have gone that way -- the grass would have showed it . \\n it seems that she had teleported . \\n it was strange . \\n lilith was a succubus . \\n they did not possess the skills to teleport . \\n she had to have gotten this from eris . \\n i decided to do the same . \\n i teleported into the deserts of tunisia , the smell of dawn in the air . \\n the sun would be up soon and so will the mortals . \\n i shuffled through the sands of the desert , my boots sinking with every step . \\n a hawk flew above me as i made my way towards a small stream that i knew was located around here . \\n i finally reached the small oasis that was surrounded by trees and wild flowers . \\n stepping through the tangled grass , the oasis inhabitants grew quiet . \\n they sensed that i was a different species than them . \\n i was an intruder and if i was n't careful nature would react . \\n coming to a stop near the stream , i leaned down and reached my hands into the water . \\n the water felt cool down my throat as i sighed with contentment . \\n water was something even those of the damned needed in order to live . \\n a gust of wind blew behind me as i quickly turned around , my demos clutched in my hand . \\n there was nothing behind me but the wind had suddenly picked up heavily . \\n the sky above me lit up with light as a ray of it shot out striking the ground in front of me . \\n i raise a hand to block my eyes from the blinding light as a humming sound vibrated through the air . \\n the oasis inhabitants began to chirp and squeak noiselessly . \\n the humming finally stopped as the light began to dim . \\n slowly , i removed my hands from shielding my eyes as i stared in front of me . \\n the sight in front of me instantly made me clutch my demos as i took a step back . \\n a woman stood in front of me with the same complexion that i 'd seen on the gods back at belham . \\n they had found me . \\n i knew it would n't have taken long , but i did n't expect it to be so soon . \\n the god or in this case goddess , stared across the forest at me . \\n one thing i can say about gods was that they were nothing like mortals pictured . \\n but then again , neither were we . \\n the goddess in front of me stood about five foot seven . \\n she had a face of a mortal teenager that was surrounded by golden blond hair . \\n her eyes were iridescent . \\n with every blink they changed to a new color . \\n unlike the other gods that i 'd seen , she did not wear armor . \\n instead she was dressed in a long black dress that went to her feet . \\n it had thick straps that were wreathed with gold foil along the bosom . \\n around her waist was a thick gold belt that connected into a circle on her stomach . \\n the symbol of the gods was etched into the circle . \\n she wore two draped golden earrings that resembled balances and around her wrist was a bracelet with several miniature lightning bolts . \\n the way they hung on the bracelet reminded me of a key ring . \\n she took a step forward and i stepped backwards . \\n i was not going to become a captive of the gods . \\n i had to get back to pearu to check on kiowa and my father even if that meant attacking one of them . \\n `` i wo n't harm you aristaeus . '' \\n at the sound of her voice i froze . \\n it was so soft as if she had spoken from far away though she was a few feet in front of me . \\n `` how do you know my name ? '' \\n `` i 've always known your name aristaeus . \\n i know everything there is to know about the son of the king of pearu . '' \\n i swallowed . \\n she knew exactly who i was , but why did i think any different . \\n `` who are you ? '' \\n `` i am astraea . \\n goddess of justice , daughter of zeus . '' \\n `` i thought zeus only had one daughter . '' \\n she laughed . \\n `` you speak like those of the mortal world . \\n it is true what the myths say about athena being my father 's favorite daughter , but there are many more of us . \\n athena is the most well-known because she is the one who leaves our world the most . '' \\n `` if you come not to harm me , than what is it that you want ? '' \\n `` i 've come to help you return home safely . '' \\n i stared at her confused . \\n was this some sort of trick ? \\n `` why would you want to help me get home ? \\n the gates of the damned are broken , should n't you be trying to execute me like the rest of your kind seemed to be doing . '' \\n `` they are not executing anyone . \\n they are simply returning them back to the realm of pearu . \\n only those who feel the need to fight back will be attacked . '' \\n `` you still did not answer my question . \\n why do you want to help me ? '' \\n `` because it 's what you want . '' \\n she said with a soft smile . \\n `` what do you know of what i want ? '' \\n `` i know a lot about you aristaeus . \\n i have watched you for a long time . \\n you are one interesting creature . \\n you 're not like the others . \\n you actually feel for the mortals . \\n i feel your compassion for them every time you reap a soul . \\n it pains you to see them in losing their lives that way . '' \\n `` you know nothing about me ! \\n `` i yelled pointing my demos at her . \\n `` i do not care for those hairless apes . \\n they are an abomination that your god created . '' \\n even as i spoke the words i 'd so often heard my father speak , i could not find myself to agree with them . \\n `` why do you hide your feelings aristaeus ? \\n are you afraid that those of your kind will not accept you if you care for mortals ? '' \\n `` what do you think ? \\n do you think creatures so immoral , so despicable that they had to be named the damned would show kindness to me for being a sympathizer . '' \\n astraea glanced off in thought . \\n she turned back towards me blinking her eyes from green to blue . \\n `` forgive me aristaeus . \\n i did n't mean to upset you . '' \\n the way she said it made something stir in my chest . \\n i wanted to comfort her and tell her that she did n't upset me , but i stayed in place . \\n i needed to get away from her . \\n she was doing strange things to me . \\n i found myself gazing into her eyes every time she spoke . \\n it was like i was in a trance . \\n i was so taken with her despite the anger i was supposed to feel that the hand that was holding my demos had loosened . \\n i realized that she was watching me staring a hole into her . \\n i cleared my throat and gripped my demos in my other hand . \\n `` can you really get me back into pearu ? '' \\n she nodded . \\n `` what about the other gods ? \\n what about your father ? '' \\n `` they do not know that you are here . \\n i have hidden us from their view . \\n my father knows that i am here , but he is too busy right now to figure out why . \\n however , it 's only of time before he comes this way to find out so we need to leave . '' \\n `` how do we get there ? '' \\n `` there is a hidden entrance not far from here . \\n you can enter into your world from there . '' \\n she made her way towards me as i tensed . \\n it was only after she was past me that i relax a fraction . \\n taking a deep breath , i hoped that she was not leading me off to slaughter as i followed behind her . \\n the two of us walked in silence with nothing but the noises of nature to keep us company . \\n she did n't seem to worry about the fact that i was heavily armed . \\n she could probably handle herself . \\n `` if you are the goddess of justice , are n't you supposed to be carrying a torch ? '' \\n i said breaking the silence . \\n `` i do not carry a torch . \\n i am the torch . '' \\n `` you 're the torch ? '' \\n astraea nodded . \\n `` during war , my body glows signaling the start of the battle . \\n i walk behind my father as i hand him his bolts of destruction . '' \\n `` do you have any powers of your own ? '' \\n `` yes , though i am afraid that i can not share them with you . \\n it goes against our rules . '' \\n i scoffed . \\n `` did n't know you guys actually had rules you had to follow ? '' \\n `` of course . \\n why would n't we ? \\n we have a world and community just like creatures of the damned and mortals . \\n and like you we must follow rules if we are to stay united . '' \\n `` a world like ours huh , what 's it called . '' \\n astraea laughed . \\n `` nice try , but you know that i ca n't reveal that to you . '' \\n she had a cute laugh , i thought to myself . \\n `` well since you can not reveal much about your world , maybe you can fill me in on why you find me interesting . '' \\n `` i told you . \\n you 're different . '' \\n `` that does n't sound too interesting . \\n not enough to watch someone and know everything about them . '' \\n astraea turned towards me , her eyes now a shade of pink . \\n the way she looked at me made me feel uncomfortable . \\n i cleared my throat and turned my attention in front of me . \\n i had been so busy trying to figure her out that i had n't noticed that i was no longer walking behind her , but beside her . \\n `` how old are you ? '' \\n i asked . \\n `` i 'm only saying it because you look young . '' \\n `` in mortal years , i 'm sixteen . '' \\n `` and in god years ? '' \\n `` the number is too long to speak . '' \\n she said . \\n she reached down and snatched up a flower slowly inhaling it . \\n `` well , according to mortal years , i 'm seventeen . '' \\n `` i know . '' \\n `` you know ? '' \\n i asked raising my eyebrow . \\n `` i told you i know everything about you . \\n though you are the age of seventeen , you act far wiser than your years . \\n some of the decisions you have made , i could n't picture a young male mortal making . '' \\n `` humph , tell that to my father . \\n in his eyes i 'm nothing more than a child . '' \\n astraea said nothing . \\n it was obvious she had seen the numerous encounters that i 've had with my father . \\n i found myself getting a little embarrassed and hope that she did not see me in the same light as he did . \\n i do n't know why i cared what she thought , but i did . \\n `` your father will come to respect you in time . '' \\n she said speaking after a moment of silence . \\n `` his greed is just clouding his judgment right now . \\n he loves you aristaeus . \\n you do not have to wonder about that . '' \\n `` that 's a bit of a reach astraea . \\n i know you gods are supposed to see the good in everyone , even those of the damned , but when it comes to the king , there is nothing of love in his body . \\n only tolerance . '' \\n the two of us said nothing as we continued to walk . \\n dawn was now over as the sun broke through the clouds . \\n i found myself squinting my eyes as my annoyance for the heat once again rose . \\n `` how much further do we have to go ? '' \\n `` not much farther . \\n it 's just over that hill . '' \\n `` could n't we just teleport to the entrance . \\n that would probably save some time . '' \\n `` yes it would save some time , but it will also alert the gods to you . \\n it 's best you remain under my veil until we get there . '' \\n `` will you be in trouble for helping me ? '' \\n `` yes . '' \\n `` then why help . '' \\n i asked filled with worry . \\n `` i told you , because you wanted it . '' \\n i found myself staring at the side of astraea 's face . \\n she 'd come all the way down here to risk punishment just because it was something that i wanted . \\n it did n't make any sense . \\n we knew nothing of each other , more like i knew nothing of her , yet here we were . \\n for a second i thought that maybe this could be one of her powers . \\n maybe she granted people 's wishes , but that did n't seem right . \\n she was a goddess of justice , not a genie . \\n `` is this some type of mission you 're on ? '' \\n `` huh ? '' \\n she asked turning to me her face filled with confusion . \\n i felt my chest tighten as i once again looked away from her . \\n what was she doing to me ? \\n did she have me under some kind of spell ? \\n maybe this is why mortals ' myths claim that they could not stand to look upon gods and angels . \\n `` you said you 've been watching me for a while , and now you 're down here risking yourself with punishment for me . \\n i 've read somewhere that angels travel to the mortal world to carry missions and i just wondered if it was the same for gods . \\n am i your mission ? '' \\n astraea laughed . \\n `` i wish you were my mission . \\n maybe then i could explain to others why i am constantly staring down at you . \\n they do not seem to believe that you only interest me . '' \\n we came to a stop near the edges of a lake . \\n on the other side of it were tiny huts that were inhabited by groups of mortals . \\n `` we are here . \\n this lake is a portal to your world . \\n it should bring you in the countryside near nicolle , though i warn you the land is inhabited by sirens . '' \\n `` do n't worry . \\n i 've dealt with sirens before . '' \\n the two of us stared at each other awkwardly . \\n despite my earlier rush on returning to pearu , i found myself not wanting to leave astraea just yet . \\n she seemed to sense this as she gave me a smile . \\n `` go aristaeus . \\n your mother is waiting for you . \\n she is worried . '' \\n i nodded but still did not move . \\n `` will you be okay ? '' \\n `` yes . \\n now hurry , my veil is weakening . '' \\n i nodded and walked towards the black water of the lake . \\n i stepped in the cold water as it soaked the bottom of my pants . \\n i made my way to the middle and felt the opening she was talking about . \\n turning around , i took another glance at astraea as she stood on the hill watching me . \\n thunder roared as flashes of light lit up the sky . \\n `` go aristaeus ! \\n poseidon is coming . \\n go now ! '' \\n i did n't need any further persuading . \\n poseidon was the king of the sea , lakes , and rivers . \\n he could easily capture me . \\n i dived down into the opening and swam my way further below . \\n the water vibrated and i knew poseidon was in the water behind me . \\n the sound of the water roared in my ears as i felt it grip my legs trying to pull me backwards . \\n it held on tight as i kicked at it . \\n i was almost near the world of pearu . \\n i could feel the slight warmth i always did when it came to my home . \\n glancing down , i saw a brown haired man gripping my legs . \\n he wore a gold crown with spikes that swooped up making a wave . \\n his strength was indescribable that he almost had me . \\n i could n't let astraea 's sacrifice go to waste . \\n calling forth my demon powers , i released a burst of fire through my body . \\n the fire shot to poseidon 's hands as he let go and fanned around him . \\n that slight distraction was enough for me to escape from his grasp and through the opening to pearu . \\n my head burst through the surface as i wasted no time swimming towards land . \\n a couple of sirens leaned against a wooden boat , but at the sight of me they dove in the water . \\n i pulled up out of the water onto the land and withdrew my demos pointing it at them . \\n `` do you know who i am ? '' \\n the sirens shrunk back in fear . \\n the redhead that seemed to be the one dyos described raised her hands in surrender . \\n `` please forgive me my young lord . \\n we did not know it was you . \\n we thought you were an intruder . '' \\n `` do not lie to me . \\n i know that you 've been trying to take souls from those of pearu . \\n if i find proof of this , that will be the end to you and your land . \\n is that clear ? '' \\n `` yes , your highness . '' \\n i backed away from them , my hand still clutching my demos . \\n it was n't until i was a good few feet away that i turned and ran . \\n i hopped off the silver wagon and thanked the owner for giving me a lift . \\n walking up to the gates of the palace , i noticed the doubling of guards . \\n at the sight of me , the guards rushed forward . \\n `` your highness , you 're alive . \\n we were told everyone in belham were either killed or taken away by the gods . '' \\n `` i am fine . '' \\n i said raising my hand . \\n `` where are my father and kiowa ? '' \\n `` the queen is inside palace . \\n she was with your friend dyos but at the news of belham being destroyed , he left to go find you . \\n the king is on his way back here from arwid . \\n he should arriving shortly . '' \\n i nodded . \\n `` stay alert . \\n i want this palace guarded at all times . \\n commander send some of your men to fetch dyos , i 'm going up to see kiowa . '' \\n `` yes , your highness . '' \\n `` once you return , pull up the bridge . \\n no one but the king is to enter the palace . \\n understood . '' \\n `` yes , your highness . '' \\n i left them to their assignments as i ran up the steps of the palace . \\n the palace had a cold feeling to it more than usual . \\n as i ran past the servants , i asked them whereabouts of my mother . \\n they told me she was still in my wing . \\n i raced up the stairs to my room and threw open my door . \\n kiowa laid across my bed dress in her green nightgown , tears streaming down her face . \\n at the sight of me she stopped crying and leaped up . \\n `` aristaeus ! '' \\n `` yes mother , it is i. '' she ran towards me and pulled me in a tight hug . \\n i felt my arms wrap around her as she sobbed into my chest . \\n her luminous purple hair had a dull shine to it and her face was one of paleness . \\n `` oh aristaeus , i 'm so happy you 're alive . \\n i 'm so happy the gods spared you . \\n i could n't get you through on the phone lines and when i heard the news , i thought for certain you 'd been killed . '' \\n `` everything is alright now . \\n i am safe . '' \\n kiowa pulled away from me and grasped my face in her hands . \\n `` you must n't leave . \\n i do not care what kavos says . \\n i will not hear of this time . \\n if you leave , i leave . '' \\n `` let 's hope it does not come to that mother . \\n now let 's get you cleaned up and get us some dinner . \\n father should be arriving soon . '' \\n `` yes , you 're right . \\n i 'll get ready and have the servants prepare a meal . '' \\n kiowa ran off to her room as i made my way to the wash . \\n i quickly cleaned and dressed into a purple suit blazer and my black pants . \\n i was sitting on my bed tying my boots when the doors opened revealing dyos . \\n `` aristaeus ! \\n you 're alive . '' \\n he ran towards me to hug me but i stopped him raising a hand . \\n `` did i not tell you to keep an eye out on kiowa ? '' \\n `` i know , but when i heard that you were in trouble i had to come . \\n what was i supposed to do , stay ? '' \\n `` yes . '' \\n i answered with anger . \\n `` i do not care if zeus himself told you to come , i told you to watch my mother . \\n the rogues are going around assassinating royalty and my mother could have been next . '' \\n dyos sighed . \\n `` i know . \\n i 'm sorry aristaeus . \\n i promise you i was making my way back to her when the guards came . \\n i wo n't abandon her again . \\n you can trust me . '' \\n `` it 's okay . \\n let 's just go down for dinner . \\n father should be here soon . '' \\n we made our way downstairs to the foyer just as the doors to the palace burst open . \\n my father strode in as the servants bowed down to him . \\n behind him were the general and the members of the courant . \\n at the sight of me , he stopped . \\n in that split second , he allowed me to see what astraea had been speaking about . \\n in that split second , he seemed worried . \\n in that split second , it was over . \\n `` i see you made it out alive . \\n you 're not so useless after all . '' \\n `` it is nice to see you to father . \\n may i have a word with you ? '' \\n `` not now aristaeus . '' \\n my father said walking past me . \\n `` i have a meeting . '' \\n `` well this is important , i have some information - '' `` aristaeus we will listen to your information later . '' \\n the general said speaking up `` right now we have to get ready . '' \\n dyos and i stared at each other as we stared at my father . \\n my father was shooting a glare in the general 's direction that said he did not want me knowing that . \\n that glare instantly put me at unease . \\n `` ready ? \\n ready for what . '' \\n my father straightened his jacket and stared at me calmly . \\n `` for what we 've been waiting for . \\n tonight we plan . \\n and then we go to war . '' \\n `` war ? '' \\n dyos said just as confused as i was . \\n `` war with whom ? '' \\n `` the gods . '' \\n answered the general . \\n `` we the damned will attack the gods . '' \\n five dyos and i sat outside my father 's office waiting for the meeting to be over . \\n after announcing his plans to go to war with the gods , the general swept him and the members of the courant off to his chambers for a private meeting . \\n i tried to follow them but was held back by my father 's guards . \\n i stayed outside the door arguing with the guards before kiowa finally came to sweep dyos and i off for dinner . \\n after the dinner we separated , kiowa off to her garden trapped in her thoughts and dyos and i here under the scrutiny of guards . \\n `` i do n't take it that he likes you very much '' i turned my eyes from the glass of kampe blood over to dyos . \\n `` who ? '' \\n dyos pointed over in the direction of the guards as my eyes followed to the demon he was speaking about . \\n our eyes connected as i released a soft chuckle . \\n `` ah , that fellow . \\n we have a score to settle according to him though i 'm afraid in the end it would make even more my adversary . '' \\n dyos laughed as broxton shot me a glare . \\n he did not take too kindly to my words and without a doubt he would retaliate soon for his humiliation . \\n `` i miss this . '' \\n dyos said staring at his empty glass . \\n he waved a hand to a servant that was standing by the wall as they quickly made their way over to refill his glass . \\n dyos like the rest of the demons i knew preferred to drink fox tears . \\n i think only the king and i could handle the harsh liquid of kampe blood which made us seem very virile to the ladies of pearu . \\n once dyos glass was filled , he continued with his conversation . \\n `` i miss us lounging around the palace causing trouble for the guards , annoying the king , or even going out into the city for entertainment . \\n now because of the rogues , everything is in ruins . \\n they have caused a problem between us and the gods that the individuals of pearu are too afraid to go outside their homes . \\n they 're afraid that zeus is walking the streets of pearu ready to dish out punishment to anyone he sees . '' \\n `` the citizens of pearu should not worry themselves with the thought of zeus walking the streets of pearu . \\n the king will not allow it no matter how powerful the god may be . '' \\n `` you 've the seen the god in action when you were at belham did n't you ? \\n do you think he will show mercy on us despite the transgressions of the rogues ? '' \\n i thought back to the barn at belham and how the gods had swooped in the place . \\n i remember at first glance thinking they were chasing after us to kill us . \\n but it was only after speaking to astraea that i was told different . \\n they did not wish to harm us ; they were just following the bylaws . \\n the creatures of the damned had challenged the rules of zeus by breaking through the gates of pearu and trying to enter the mortal world . \\n those whom had tried to escape had brought the wrath on zeus themselves . \\n `` aristaeus ? '' \\n `` i do not think we will be punished for their actions . '' \\n i said breaking away from my thoughts to answer him . \\n `` he would probably just enforce a stronger law so no more creations like the rogues can be made . \\n father says that eris is the first ruler of this world and the most powerful , which is why those of the damned flock to her . \\n being dethroned by zeus has left her filled with vengeance . \\n breaking the gates of pearu i think is the first step of her revenge . '' \\n dyos and i got quiet and i could tell the guards behind was listening to our conversation . \\n they glanced around at each nervously and i knew they were worried about what i 'd said . \\n if eris was on a road of revenge because of being dethroned , then would she come for the throne ? \\n their minds were spinning with whom they would side for if such a thing happened . \\n would they follow the king that they served under for centuries , or would they flock to the first ruler who brought true meaning to the reality of hell the mortals feared . \\n the doors to my father 's office opened as the courant exited . \\n they nodded their heads as they walked by as the servants walked in front of them leading them out of the palace . \\n the general stepped out after them and walked over to us . \\n `` aristaeus , the king would like a word with you . '' \\n he said . \\n he then turned to his son . \\n `` dyos , you will be leaving with me . '' \\n `` but father , i told aristaeus i would remain here with him . \\n we have n't seen each other in months . \\n we have some catching up to do . '' \\n `` this is no time for foolishness dyos . '' \\n the general said . \\n his voice was a bit shaky and he appeared to be tired . \\n his young face for once now seemed its true age . \\n he was stressed . \\n `` you will come with me now . \\n that is final . '' \\n dyos seemed to pick up on what i saw in his father as he no longer argued with him . \\n he stood up from the chair he was in and placed his glass on the table beside him . \\n turning to me he said , `` i 'm afraid i have to take my leave aristaeus . \\n i 'll send word soon on when we can get together . '' \\n i nodded at dyos as he and his father made their way down the hall and around the corner towards the front doors of the palace . \\n pushing up from my seat , i placed my glass on the table and walked into my father 's office . \\n unlike the os ' mars office , my father 's was one of hidden ruins . \\n the whole composition gave off a world of atlantis atmosphere as water ran from small square holes in the ceilings down to two long rectangles constructed in the ground . \\n the floor had clear tiles that displayed the colorful fish swimming beneath them . \\n the walls to the left and right however were filled with bouncing balls of black lights that were being heated by fire lined within the walls . \\n those black lights were the souls of those from the mortal world whom had gone against the rules of their world and were now receiving the punishment of eternal damnation . \\n in the middle of the room was my father sitting in his throne chair . \\n the silver skulls on the hands of the chair gleamed ; the eyes lightning controlling the fire that tortured the mortal souls . \\n his fingers were entwined and his eyes were closed as he had a silent meeting with himself . \\n however , as i neared towards him , they slowly opened revealing the light shade of purple of his shattered eyes . \\n the dullness let me know that just like the general , he was tired . \\n `` you asked to see me '' my father stared at me for a moment as if he was peering through my core . \\n his eyes roamed up before landing on mine . \\n `` you said you had information for me . '' \\n `` yes . \\n i think the rogues had help from someone within in belham . \\n her name is lilith and she 's a succubus . \\n she 's been exiled for only a couple months but i have yet to figure out why . \\n i thought that maybe you could tell me since all bans go through you . '' \\n `` lilith ? \\n her name sounds familiar yes , but i do not recall banning anyone of that name . \\n what makes you believe that she is a gofer of eris ? '' \\n `` she seemed to know that gods would be there that night . \\n she claims that eris promised to her land , and she promised to spare me if only i take lilith 's hand in conjugal . '' \\n my father laughed as i raised one of my eyebrows . \\n my father was not one to chuckle or even laugh for the matter . \\n it was only of rare times that he found himself to be amused . \\n `` i see eris is still dishing out her mendacities . \\n promising false hopes and dreams in order to have those follow her despite the web of power she yields . '' \\n `` is that what 's stressing you out ? '' \\n i asked . \\n my father 's smile disappeared off his face as it was replaced by the usual scowl . \\n `` i am not stressed . \\n i am annoyed . \\n because of her actions , eris has forced me to start early on my plans to exterminate zeus and his kind . \\n i wanted to catch him unaware but now because of her , he knows i 'm coming ! '' \\n a damned soul from within the wall screamed as father and i barely blinked . \\n `` she will not get away with this . '' \\n father said quietly . \\n `` she has humiliated me for the last time . '' \\n `` do you think she will try to come for the throne ? '' \\n `` yes and no . \\n though eris is the first ruler of pearu , she has always had her sights set on something much bigger . '' \\n `` the mortal world . '' \\n i answered . \\n father nodded . \\n `` she has never been satisfied with just being the ruler of pearu . \\n she wants to rule those of mortals as well . \\n not that i could blame her much . \\n they do make for an interesting torment , though i do not have time for that . \\n i simply wish to exterminate their whole world . '' \\n i stared at my father as a gleam came to his eye at the mention of ridding the realm of mortals . \\n what he and eris did not seem to get was that without the mortals , there would be no use for our kind . \\n our world was created to be hell . \\n a punishment world for mortals . \\n without the mortals , our world would cease to exist . \\n we lived off their cruelty though we can no longer walk their world and inhale in it . \\n the damned souls of the mortals are what keep us living . \\n it 's what keeps us in existence . \\n without them , the creatures of the damned will have no one else to torture but those in pearu that in the end would bring our extinction . \\n `` father , if i may . \\n i 'd like to investigate more into lilith . '' \\n i said . \\n `` if you did not ban her to belham , then i 'm sure eris sent her there . \\n for what purposes i do not know yet . '' \\n `` that could be a possibility . \\n is there anything else ? '' \\n `` yes . \\n she said something about getting rid of kiowa like they did famar 's daughter . \\n i am worried that she will be next . '' \\n my father 's eyes darkened the dull shade disappearing . \\n `` they will not set one foot onto this land ! '' \\n he then stood up and folded his arms behind his back . \\n `` very well . \\n you may investigate this lilith , but only her . \\n if you find out anything about eris or even see a glimpse of her , you are to return to the palace immediately . \\n do you understand ? '' \\n `` yes , your highness . '' \\n `` then it is settled . \\n i shall have some guards accompany you . '' \\n `` no father . '' \\n i said quickly . \\n `` i plan to go and investigate belham . \\n if the gods see me with an army they may assume that a war has started and your plans will once again be foiled . \\n i 'll just take dyos with me . '' \\n `` you are right . \\n i do not want to alert them to my plans just of yet . \\n very well , take dyos . \\n i will inform the general that he will accompany you . '' \\n `` thank you , father . '' \\n i bowed my head and turned to leave . \\n i 'd taken four steps before my father 's voice stopped me . \\n `` aristaeus '' i turned around slowly and stared at him . \\n `` yes father . '' \\n `` how did you get back to pearu ? \\n the gates were being guarded by zeus and i 'm sure if he 'd seen you , he would have taken you with the rest to be questioned . \\n so how did you escape his sight and return here ? '' \\n without blinking i answered , `` os ' mar had spoken of another entranceway to pearu . \\n he claimed the gods moved it constantly so it would remain hidden . \\n it was only by luck that i saw the whereabouts of it this time when i was in his office . '' \\n `` is it still there ? '' \\n `` i do not think so . \\n when i tried to return , i was followed by poseidon himself . \\n he almost had me in his grasp , but i escaped . '' \\n `` where is it located ? '' \\n `` in the land of sirens . '' \\n my father nodded his eyes roaming over me in scrutiny . \\n throughout it all i stood unmoved . \\n i could feel that a part of him did not fully trust the answer i 'd given him and i was okay with it . \\n for some reason , i did not want to rat out astraea to my father . \\n my father knew nothing of her and nothing of a secret entranceway into pearu despite his being the king . \\n i knew because of the sudden events that he would not go and question zeus about it . \\n he would probably send armies out to dig around for it but i know that it would no longer be there . \\n poseidon would have alerted zeus to the fact that entranceway had been discovered and would have erased it from existence . \\n `` what 's going on with the souls ? \\n they seem to be on low supply . '' \\n i said trying to divert my father 's thoughts . \\n my father glanced over at the walls were the balls of light were hovering . \\n `` zeus has cut off our supply . \\n for now the souls are hovering between realms until further notice . '' \\n my father turned back towards me . \\n `` you should get some rest aristaeus . \\n you have a long day ahead of you tomorrow . '' \\n `` yes , father . '' \\n i bowed my head once again and quickly made my exit . \\n despite the king 's advice to get some rest , i found myself doing the exact opposite . \\n i exited the back doors of the palace and made my way down the hill to the garden . \\n few of my father 's guards were spread throughout the garden , bowing to me as i passed . \\n i found kiowa bent down in a field of wild flowers dressing them in unicorn tears . \\n `` i knew i 'd find you here . '' \\n kiowa smiled up at me her hands not once ceasing . \\n `` where else in this palace can i go to have time to myself ? \\n she stood up and placing her urn down . \\n `` did you get to chance to meet with your father ? '' \\n `` yes i did . \\n we spoke and he agreed to let me handle some things on my own . '' \\n `` well that is nice . \\n it 's about time he starts giving you some serious responsibilities around here . \\n after all you will be the next in line for the throne once he is gone . \\n maybe now he is seeing the leadership qualities that you possess . '' \\n `` i 'm not so sure on that . \\n i 'm sure he has a secret agenda . '' \\n kiowa walked up to me and patted my face . \\n `` well it 's best you have one too then . '' \\n she grabbed my hand tightly in hers . \\n `` come let 's go inside . \\n i 'm sure your father is getting ready to announce night . '' \\n `` yes . \\n he did look tired . '' \\n the two of us walked up the hill with the guards and servants following close behind . \\n `` aristaeus i was thinking . '' \\n kiowa said . \\n `` in time you will be taking the throne despite what your father wants . \\n in keeping with the accordance of the laws of pearu , it is time that we start looking for you a bride . '' \\n `` mother you ca n't be serious . \\n i swear sometimes you think of the strangest things to say . \\n maybe father is right to keep you in doors . \\n those flower fields have driven you insane . '' \\n `` the flower fields have done no such thing so do not go announcing reports like that to your father . \\n he would have them cut down within seconds . \\n i am simply looking out for your best interests aristaeus . \\n believe it or not you will have to rule this world and a crown princess is needed at your side . \\n now i know of some lovely earth demons that will make an okay crown princess despite them being bottom feeders . '' \\n i stopped and grabbed kiowa by the shoulders turning her to face me . \\n `` mother , i know you think you are doing your duty as queen , but please stop it . \\n i am not ready for a bride especially an earth demon . '' \\n `` well demons are the only ones that you can marry . \\n my goodness you 're thinking of wedding a succubus are you ? '' \\n `` i am not dyos mother , the person i choose will be much better than that . '' \\n at my words , kiowa stared at me as knowing came on her face . \\n `` you 've found someone , have n't you aristaeus ? '' \\n `` you are speaking nonsense again . '' \\n `` no i think i 'm speaking the truth . \\n it 's clear in your eyes . \\n you have found someone of interest . \\n who is she ? \\n is she someone in the city ? \\n or is she someone you 've met during your time in belham ? '' \\n i stared in horror at kiowa who continued her wave of questions unaware that the servants were listening . \\n `` she is n't mortal is she ? '' \\n she said breaking my thoughts . \\n `` aristaeus please tell me that you did not fall for one of them . \\n your father will have a soul spasm not to mention the type of spasm i would have . '' \\n `` no mother she is not mortal , in fact there is no one . \\n so can we just let this go ? '' \\n kiowa opened her mouth to say something else but the sound of the king 's horn stopped her . \\n the king was now asleep meaning it was night time in the world of pearu . \\n `` fine , i 'll let it go tonight . \\n but we shall talk about this again . '' \\n i nodded all the while thinking about escaping the house sometime in the morning . \\n kiowa and i made our way into the palace as we bid each other good night at the crossway between our quarters . \\n once she was out of sight , i made my way upstairs to my room and got dressed for bed . \\n completely dressed , i walked over to the phone in my room and punched in the number for general 's castle . \\n the line beeped two times before someone answered . \\n `` castle of orham , who may i direct your call to . '' \\n `` this is prince aristaeus for dyos . '' \\n `` one moment , your highness . '' \\n the line held again for a few moments before dyos voice entered onto the line . \\n `` ah , so you live . \\n my , have the king grown weak . '' \\n `` on the contrary , i think he 's grown stronger . \\n i can no longer read his thoughts as use to . '' \\n `` damn him and his ingenious intellect . \\n oh well , what is it that i can do for you at this witching hour my friend ? '' \\n `` i am calling to confirm if the general has spoken to you of our plans for tomorrow . '' \\n `` yes . \\n smooth move covering up our part hopping with investigating . \\n i think you might be giving your highness a run for his money . '' \\n `` this is not a cover up . '' \\n i said speaking into the phone . \\n `` we are going out on business . \\n my father is not seeing clearly right now . \\n the rogues has him rattled and i 'm afraid of what it might lead him to do . \\n his actions might lead to the destruction of pearu and i can not sit idly by and watch that happen . '' \\n `` ah , spoken like a king . \\n you are well on your way to the throne . \\n what is it that you will need from me ? '' \\n `` i need you to be ready to go soon as morning breaks . '' \\n `` why so early ? '' \\n dyos asked . \\n his voice was filled with confusion . \\n `` does n't the palace have mandatory breakfast ? '' \\n `` yes it does , but i 'm afraid i will not be able to join them this time . '' \\n i said sighing . \\n `` kiowa had brought it upon herself to find me a bride . '' \\n dyos cackled into the phone as i pulled it away in annoyance . \\n `` are you done yet ? '' \\n `` not nearly . '' \\n he laughed . \\n `` so the queen is shopping around for potential crown princesses ? \\n who does she have in line ? \\n let me guess , earth demons . '' \\n `` yes , she claims she knows some who would do well to rule beside me . '' \\n `` ha ! \\n earth demons are nothing more than bottom feeder rejects . \\n they will bring down the monarchy aristaeus , you just watch and see . \\n you need a creature fit to rule beside . \\n you need to bring in a new era . \\n you need a princess of siren blood . '' \\n i frowned at the phone . \\n `` siren blood ? \\n you 're recommending me someone of siren blood . \\n did n't a siren just try to kill you the other night ? '' \\n `` yes , she did . \\n but that does n't mean i did n't have any fun with her . \\n she was stunning so i 'll disregard what she did . '' \\n i rolled my eyes . \\n `` is everyone speaking nonsense his evening ? \\n there are way better choices for the throne then a siren . '' \\n `` you 've found someone ! \\n did n't you ? '' \\n `` great , now you sound like kiowa . '' \\n `` then it must be true . '' \\n dyos said with a laugh . \\n `` tell me , who is she ? \\n is she someone from belham ? \\n tell me you did n't fall in love with one of those skinless apes did you aristaeus ? '' \\n `` goodbye dyos . '' \\n i disconnected the phone and walked over to my bed . \\n i could n't believe kiowa and dyos . \\n nothing in me had changed . \\n they were just teasing me , i told myself . \\n so why when i laid down on my bed , did i see the face of astraea . \\n six the carriage pulled to a stop outside the gates of pearu . \\n stepping out , i stared at the group of creatures that were working to repair the black dented gate . \\n however , at our arrival they turned around , faces worry that whoever was stepping out of the carriage would be the king . \\n at the sight of me , they calmed but yet were still alert . \\n `` gracious , she really did do some damage on it , did n't she ? '' \\n dyos said stepping out of the carriage behind me . \\n he wore the clothes of the kingdom , his black hair braided into two long plats . \\n `` i would love to know how she got one over on the gods . '' \\n `` if i were you , i would not wonder about such things so loudly . '' \\n i stepped over to the two demons that had accompanied us this morning . \\n due to request , broxton had been removed from the list probably sparking more contempt he had for me . \\n `` you may head back to the palace . \\n we will take it from here . '' \\n `` but your highness , the king said to wait for you at the gates . '' \\n `` i have no idea the time we shall return . '' \\n i said . \\n `` i do not want to waste your time when you can be performing other duties . \\n do not worry , if we need transportation , i will call for you . '' \\n the demon appeared a bit skeptical but finally nodded his head in agreement . \\n he climbed into the carriage closing the door as it started and headed down the road back towards the countryside of the palace . \\n turning around , i faced dyos . \\n `` let 's go . '' \\n `` aristaeus , you know that i am willing to follow you everywhere . \\n but are you sure that it is okay for us to be on the outside of these gates ? '' \\n `` yes , my father has spoken with zeus . \\n he told him that we are investigating how the gates were broken ? '' \\n `` ha ! \\n and zeus believed him . '' \\n dyos laughed . \\n `` well we are investigating . '' \\n `` you 're investigating . \\n the king does not care . \\n i know that he has other plans . \\n my father has been hush hush these days but i know when something is up . \\n let 's just be careful , okay . '' \\n `` agreed . '' \\n the workers stepped out of the way as we approached the fence . \\n there was a new secretary of the courts at the fence today since the old one had been killed during yesterday 's escape . \\n we went through the usual forms of verifying ourselves and a new scanner that took our blood . \\n once everything was approved , the doors to belham slid open and we entered through . \\n the first thing i noticed when we stepped into the barn of belham was the tables were still overturned . \\n there was dried blood from the battle between the creatures of our world . \\n the only clue that the gods had been here was that of their symbol burned into the walls . \\n `` remind me not to get banned from pearu . '' \\n dyos said staring around . \\n `` i do not know how it is that you survived in such filth for so long . '' \\n i ignored him as i removed my demos . \\n if lilith or anyone else from the rogue was here , i did n't want to be caught off guard . \\n dyos followed my suit as he removed his sword , his attention no more of laughter . \\n `` stay down here , i 'm going to check upstairs were the rooms are . \\n if anybody comes , restrain them without killing them . \\n but if it comes to your or them , do not hesitate to kill them . '' \\n `` understood . '' \\n i left dyos downstairs as i headed up the steps to the second floor . \\n the floor boards that had once been sturdy were now wobbly from the battle of yesterday . \\n as i passed the rooms , i opened the door of each one . \\n all of them seemed to be vacant , nothing but the resident 's belongings being left behind . \\n i finally arrived at the room i 'd been staying in and slowly pushed the door opened . \\n unlike the others , my room was not how i left it . \\n i did n't have much to begin with here in belham , but the little bit i did have was thrown around the room . \\n the covers from my bed were ripped to shreds , the mattress and pillows as well . \\n the drawers to the wooden desk in my room were busted , the stacks of paper now drenched in black ink as it lay scattered on the floor . \\n someone had been looking for something , and i 'm sure that someone was lilith . \\n but what was it ? \\n what did she think that i had ? \\n i picked up my belongings filtering through to see if anything was left as a clue , but there was nothing . \\n i exited my room and continued to search the second floor coming up on a lost . \\n by the time that i came downstairs , dyos had moved from his spot by the door of pearu and was staring at the symbol the gods had left behind . \\n `` what do you think it means / '' he asked without turning around . \\n `` i think it 's a warning to eris . \\n maybe to let her know that they are involved in it now . '' \\n `` but should n't she already know that . \\n they see everything , from the mortal world to ours . \\n which is why i do n't understand why they have yet to do something about her ? '' \\n `` their concerns are of the mortals , not of the damned . '' \\n i said rounding the bar . \\n `` i am going down to os ' mar 's office . \\n are you coming ? '' \\n `` yeah . \\n i 'm right behind you '' i headed into the door behind the bar dyos following close behind me . \\n the office like my room was disarray . \\n i now started to piece together the clues . \\n lilith was after something in os ' mar 's office . \\n a flash of her standing in front of me holding os ' mar 's keys came to mind . \\n it was obvious that she thought that whatever she needed from os ' mar that i would have . \\n it was n't a secret how close os ' mar and i was around here . \\n however , we were not that close for os ' mar to give me his secrets . \\n `` do you think eris did this ? '' \\n `` more like her lackey . '' \\n i picked up the overturn desk and threw it to the side . \\n the hole in the floor was sealed so it seemed the room below had gone untouched . \\n i grabbed the phone that lay on the floor and pressed the numbers i had memorized os ' mar doing yesterday . \\n it 's not like i knew something of this nature would happen , it was always just a precaution . \\n i memorized everything around me . \\n once all the numbers were pressed in , the floor began to move opening as i placed the phone back on its hook . \\n `` how did you know that was there ? '' \\n dyos said peering down into the hole . \\n `` os ' mar showed me once . \\n let 's go . '' \\n we headed down the spiral stairs as the ceiling closed back up above us . \\n i was glad for that . \\n i did n't want anyone that could be watching to sneak down here on us . \\n we came to a stop at the doors that i visited yesterday . \\n `` it has a scanner . '' \\n dyos said . \\n `` how are we supposed to get past that ? \\n shall i call for the king to get os ' mars information ? '' \\n `` there will be no need for that . '' \\n with one clean slash i removed the scanner from the door . \\n the skeleton that was attached to the scanner lay twitching on the ground . \\n reaching in , i grabbed the loose wires in the wall and twisted to my liking until the doors snapped open . \\n `` whoa ! \\n where did you learn that ? \\n i do n't care you 've got to teach me . \\n i have a couple places that i need to get into . '' \\n `` no dyos , you will not use these skills for whatever illegal activities that you have planned . '' \\n `` so says the prince breaking into someone else 's property . '' \\n `` i 'm investigating . '' \\n dyos scoffed as i stepped through the doors . \\n this room was untouched . \\n no one had been down here . \\n but even as i thought that , i could not stop the feeling that was creeping up on me . \\n i walked over to the vault on the wall and opened it the same way i did the scanner outside the room . \\n the door swung open as the smell of dragon scales hit my nose . \\n dragon scale coins lay piled up in rows to the ceiling , and in between them was a broken jar of scattered moonstones . \\n since i had no idea exactly what moonstones were in the jar , i could n't find out if any were taken . \\n `` the vault seems safe . '' \\n dyos said peering over my shoulder . \\n `` the money is still there . \\n it 's a waste really . '' \\n `` it will have to remain until someone from the court comes . \\n this is os ' mar 's money . \\n once we discover his whereabouts , he may come back and claim it . '' \\n i closed the door to the vault . \\n `` seal it back . '' \\n dyos stepped up and placed his hand against the lining of the door . \\n he called forth fire to seal the door . \\n while he was taking care of that , i walked over to the locked boxes . \\n calling forth my own fire , i burned the edges of the door until i could pry it open . \\n inside were the boxes that i had brought os ' mar over the years . \\n as i stared into the locked box , i took in the black box that was unlatched , its top pointing to the ceiling of the lock box . \\n the contents in the box were missing . \\n i pushed away from the lock box and turned to dyos . \\n `` dyos ! \\n check those lock boxes on those sides to see if they are opened and missing their contents . '' \\n dyos heard the urgency in my voice and ran to the other side of the room . \\n one by one , we removed the doors to the lock boxes only to find opened black boxes , their contents gone . \\n by the time we finished it was clear , that everything within these boxes were missing . \\n dyos walked over to me . \\n his eyes were held with concern as he stared into my face . \\n `` i do n't understand aristaeus . \\n what is missing ? \\n what was in these boxes ? '' \\n slowly , i turned to dyos as the words i did n't want to say came tumbling out . \\n `` souls . \\n mortal souls . '' \\n dyos and i headed back to pearu since there was nothing else to find in belham . \\n i split ways with him once we were within in the gate , claiming that there was someone i needed to see . \\n he did n't believe me , but understood that i needed some time to myself . \\n without me saying anything , he told me that he would keep the king occupied until i returned . \\n once he left , i headed in the opposite direction towards the ocean . \\n i knew the possibility of the entranceway still remaining in nicolle was a long shot so i did n't head there . \\n i also knew that my father had reacted just like i 'd predicted and sent his army to search all lands of the sirens until he found the portal . \\n he was wasting power when he should have had those guards defending the palace . \\n carriages and carts rode by filled with food from the souks as the drivers turned their heads watching me as i made my way through the countryside . \\n i had to hurry because word would soon get back to my father that i was venturing towards the ocean . \\n my father would immediately have me brought back and questioned . \\n in due time , i would tell him what i know . \\n for right now , it was better that he did n't trust me . \\n i came to the outskirts of the ocean and stared at the large mountain rocks that housed different creatures . \\n my boots splashed through the water as it soaked my pants . \\n i needed to get to the middle of the ocean . \\n if i got to the middle of the ocean , hopefully i would find the entrance way that would take me out of pearu . \\n the closer i got to the middle of the ocean , the higher the water grew . \\n it was n't before long that it was up to my chin and i was floating by . \\n dipping forward , i dropped my head underwater and swam until i reached the middle . \\n coming upon the middle of the ocean , i waved my hands around trying to feel the hum that would announce the portal . \\n my hands grasped around at the water as fishes darted back and forth around me . \\n it was n't anywhere around the surface , so maybe it was down towards the bottom . \\n i tipped forward heading towards the bottom of the ocean but again there was nothing . \\n wading in the water , i tried to think of where the portal could be . \\n i was pretty sure that it opened up somewhere in the water . \\n kicking off the floor of the ocean , i swam upwards until i broke the surface . \\n water filled my eyes , as wet strands of my hair clung to my face . \\n `` there he is ! '' \\n i turned around in the water at the voice to see my father 's men up on the hill bank . \\n my father stepped out of the carriage and stared down at me . \\n the sight of him being here to soon worried me . \\n maybe he knew i would come looking for the portal . \\n it seems as dyos did n't sway his attention away from me . \\n there was even possibility that my father had n't been at the palace when dyos returned . \\n he probably had been waiting on me since i left . \\n raising a hand , my father pointed towards me . \\n `` bring him to me , even if you have to harm him . '' \\n the guards tore down the hill with battle screams . \\n broxton was among them as he ran in front of the crowd . \\n on his belt , i could see a small dagger . \\n as my eyes connected with his , it spoke volumes . \\n he would try to kill me today . \\n he would probably mark it off as an accident or self-defense , but either way in his mind today i would be out of the picture . \\n i swam further out of their reach before dipping back down in the water . \\n i knew there was nowhere really for me to run out here . \\n i would be dragged back by my father 's guards and let broxton tell it , i will be floating dead in this water . \\n at that thought , another sudden thought came to me . \\n closing my eyes , i wished to be outside the world of pearu . \\n i wished to be in the world of mortals . \\n i wished to be back in the oasis of tunisia . \\n i held my eyes tight as i wished for this . \\n i counted to ten before opening them and finding myself still in within the body of water . \\n i pushed back up to the surface expecting to see the guards , but instead i saw trees , grass , and the night sky of the mortal world . \\n on the banks of the lake was astraea perched on a rock . \\n i quickly swam towards her , pulling myself out of the water one i reached the bank . \\n water ran off of me as i stumbled towards her . \\n astraea stared at me her eyes blinking from white to gold . \\n her lips parted into a smile as she spoke the words that it seemed i had been waiting to hear . \\n `` hello aristaeus . '' \\n seven astraea stood up from the rock and walked towards me . \\n i found myself once again staring into her eyes locked into a trance . \\n it was only the thought of the conversation with kiowa that finally made me pull away from her eyes . \\n `` are you casting a spell on me ? '' \\n `` huh ? '' \\n astraea asked tilting her head to the side . \\n `` never mind . '' \\n i walked past her and sat down on the rock she had once claimed . \\n calling fire to myself , i allowed a low heat to dry my clothing and hair . \\n `` i 'm surprised you came . \\n i thought you would have been locked away for helping me yesterday . '' \\n i said once my clothing was dry . \\n `` i was locked away . \\n i escaped . '' \\n `` you escaped . \\n why risk it if you 're going to get in more trouble ? '' \\n `` as i told you before aristaeus . '' \\n astraea said sitting down on the grass next to me . \\n `` it is what you wanted . \\n you wanted to leave your world . \\n you wanted to see me . '' \\n an uncomfortable silence settled between us as i found myself swallowing tightly . \\n i glanced over at astraea who was staring at me with such innocence despite the apple green color of her eyes . \\n `` well you still should n't have done it . \\n i do n't want to have any more troubles with your father when i have my own father to deal with . \\n besides , i thought you did n't grant wishes . '' \\n `` i do n't grant wishes . \\n i grant true needs . \\n you needed to escape what was happening in your world . \\n the need was so strong that it pulled at me until i answered . '' \\n `` does that happen to all the gods ? '' \\n i asked . \\n astraea shrugged . \\n `` that i do not know since we are not allowed to discuss anything about ourselves with the others . \\n i just know what i feel . \\n i think it 's because i 've formed some sort of attachment to you after watching you for all these years . '' \\n `` well , thank you for coming to my rescue . \\n i do not know how i would have explained wading in the water to my father . \\n even now i am trying to think of an excuse for when i return home . '' \\n `` why were you in the water ? '' \\n `` you did not see ? '' \\n i asked confused . \\n i thought she saw everything . \\n `` not this time . \\n i told you , i was locked away . \\n my father has banished me to my room until he can face me . '' \\n astraea sighed . \\n `` he is trying to understand my reasoning but the disobedience is a thing he must not tolerate . \\n coming to see you , i 've probably just made my case worse . '' \\n `` i 'm sorry . '' \\n `` do n't be . \\n i knew what the ramifications of my actions would be for coming here to release you and now cloaking you from their eyes . \\n they are probably searching the entire world for me . \\n once they look into pearu and see that you are missing as well , they will know then . '' \\n `` will your father tell mine ? '' \\n astraea shook her head as she stared out into the lake , the reflection of the moon shining bright against it like a mirror . \\n `` no . \\n he will handle himself . '' \\n we got quiet again for a moment . \\n the sound of crickets and beetles united creating a tranquil nighttime melody . \\n astraea turned back to me . \\n `` you did not answer my question earlier . \\n why were you in the water ? '' \\n `` i was trying to find the portal out of pearu . \\n i knew it was a long shot that it would still remain within nicolle . \\n i figured that it would have moved to another place with water , and since it was no longer in nicolle , then there was only one other body of water it could have been located in , the ocean . '' \\n astraea laughed . \\n `` it does not work that way i 'm afraid aristaeus . \\n the portals are very sensitive to the world of pearu , so they travel to places that most creatures of the damned do n't . \\n in pearu , most of the creatures of the damned fear the sirens because of their needs to take souls . \\n since they 've been cut off from the mortal world , the creatures of the damned have become their substitute . \\n because of this , you do not travel there which makes it a safe place for the portals . \\n it was only because of your strong need to escape that i was allowed to manipulate it which is a immoral thing in our world . '' \\n `` you talk about it as if it 's real . '' \\n `` they are . \\n how do you think that poseidon got there so quickly ? \\n you are a creature of the damned who was outside the portals during the lockdown . \\n it screamed for the god who governed the place it was hidden . \\n in that case it was poseidon , who is very ticked off at you by the way for burning him . '' \\n `` i should be the one that 's ticked off . '' \\n i said thinking about the tight hold the god had on my legs . \\n `` i thought he was going to pull my legs off . '' \\n astraea chuckled as she looked up towards the sky . \\n `` he 's not that bad . \\n he 's quite friendly actually . \\n you just seem to catch him during combat mode . '' \\n i nodded and stared at an eagle swooping down to pick up a fish that had hopped up out of the water . \\n it flew away with the squirming fishes trapped in its clutches . \\n i instantly imagine that fish being me and the eagle being my father . \\n as soon as i returned , he would carry me away like that . \\n this time i think it will be for good . \\n `` why did you need to escape from your father so badly ? '' \\n `` i needed to ask you a question . '' \\n i said clearing my throat surprised that she had guessed my thoughts . \\n `` what would happen if a creature of the damned where to get their hands on the souls of a mortal ? '' \\n `` that is not possible . \\n those souls are heavily guarded . \\n only my father can open those lockboxes . '' \\n `` i 'm afraid that is no longer true . '' \\n i said . \\n astraea stared at me as i continued . \\n `` i went to belham today . '' \\n `` i know . \\n i overheard athena and apollo talking about it . \\n they were supposed to be watching you , but something else grabbed their attention . '' \\n `` well they should have been watching . \\n if they had , they would have seen what i seen . \\n i went to investigate to see if i could find anything on one of eris flunkies when i noticed the disturbance in the room i 'd been staying in . \\n i checked os ' mar 's office and his office was torn apart like my room and it was then i remembered a succubus named lilith , had os ' mar 's keys . \\n that prompted me to check the hidden room beneath the floorboards were os ' mar had taken me the other day . \\n the vault in the room was still filled with currency , only a few moonstones were missing . \\n it was only an excessive pulling that i felt that made me decide to check the lockboxes . \\n i opened them to see that the boxes that i 'd carried away the mortal souls in were all empty . \\n i think lilith took them . '' \\n the silence from astraea spoke volumes . \\n the missing of the souls was not a good thing . \\n lilith taking them meant something big . \\n i stared at astraea , her face was impassive , but her eyes were the opposite . \\n the usual changing with a blink had disappeared as they were now changing as soon as they appeared . \\n it was like a rainbow-colored flashing light . \\n `` astraea . '' \\n i said placing a hand on hers . \\n a warm heat unlike the one i was used to spread through our hands making its way through our bodies . \\n astraea 's eyes stopped flashing landing on blue as she stared wide eyed at me . \\n `` are you okay ? '' \\n i said finding my voice . \\n astraea nodded -- her eyes still the size of a cat 's . \\n `` what does it mean ? \\n lilith taking the souls . '' \\n `` nothing good . '' \\n astraea said . \\n `` eris is unlike any other creature in pearu . \\n she 's not a demon or one of the damned . \\n she is a rakshasa . '' \\n `` what ? '' \\n `` do not get confused . \\n she is not a god like us , but yet she is . \\n eris was created from the foot of the hindu god of creation . \\n because the hindu god went against our great god wishes to replicate , he killed the hindu god and banished his cruel daughters to a world as malicious as them , thus pearu or in mortal worlds hell was born . \\n the two oldest daughters of the hindu god begged for forgiveness , but his youngest eris did not . \\n she felt betrayed by the great god and her sisters . \\n one night as they slept , eris killed them in their sleep . \\n while the great god was creating his world of mortals , eris had a created a world full of creatures with ill intent like her . \\n it was she who sent the snake to the mortal world to influence adam and eve to take a bite of the apple . \\n it was her first act of defiance against the great god . \\n her second came when she input cruel thoughts into the mortal cain 's head making him attack his brother . \\n her evil was a counterattack to the pureness of our god . '' \\n `` so why did n't he stop her ? \\n he could have taken care of her like he did her father . '' \\n i asked . \\n i silently thought to myself that it would have also taken care of a lot of problems that are happening today . \\n `` because our god is a forgiving one . \\n he had hopes that eris would one day see the error of her ways and change her way of thinking . \\n but she did not . \\n she continued to release her imprint of evil on the world making mortals create their own hell . \\n it had become to the point that she no longer needed to interfere , the mortals were creating havoc on their own . \\n it was then that god started to send their souls to her world . \\n if they wanted to be like her , to follow her rules of life instead of his , then they could spend their afterlife with her instead of in his world . \\n it was towards the adolf hitler reign that the great god had had enough . \\n he ordered my father to have eris dethrone from pearu , however , she caught wind of the forthcoming banishment and fled . \\n someone she disappeared from our sight . \\n it is like she never existed . '' \\n `` so why is that she took the souls ? '' \\n `` that i do not know . \\n eris , her kind , they feed on mortal flesh and spoiled food to live . \\n i do not know what she needs with their souls since she is no longer in pearu , but whatever it is can not be good . '' \\n `` of that you can be sure . '' \\n a voice came behind us . \\n astraea and i jumped up as we stared at the trees behind us . \\n there was someone standing within the trees cloaked in the darkness of the night . \\n i withdrew my demos and stood in front of astraea . \\n the figure in the trees began to move as they slowly approached the light . \\n once the figure was completely in the moonlight , i felt myself tense as my hand gripped the hilt of my demos tighter . \\n `` my , oh my aristaeus do you look like your father '' said the voice of the woman in front of me . \\n it was lilith , and yet it was n't lilith . \\n she no longer resembled the succubus i was used to seeing . \\n she stood about six feet tall and was in a form of a mortal . \\n she wore a long gold dress that was made of snake skin . \\n there was a high collar that covered her neck and the bishop sleeves came down to her wrist . \\n her dark brown hair was pulled into a high ponytail , three braids marking the sides and middle . \\n her eyes were that of the color of the dress . \\n `` and who is that we have behind you . '' \\n she peered around my shoulder as if she had n't seen astraea when she first arrived . \\n `` ah , astraea . \\n my , oh my how the mighty have fallen . '' \\n a chill that i 've never experience went through my body as i stared at the creature in front of me . \\n it could n't be . \\n `` lilith . '' \\n i breathed out . \\n `` yes it is i. '' thunder sounded above us as sharp flashes of lighting hit the ground before us . \\n the smoke from the blast instantly cleared revealing zeus , poseidon , and two other gods i did not know . \\n zeus shot a glare in astraea 's direction before directing his attention to lilith . \\n `` zeus . \\n right on time . '' \\n she said unmoved by his sudden appearance . \\n `` with the accordance to the bylaws and the courts of the universe , you are ordered to submit and return with us at once . '' \\n lilith laughed as i noticed the gold snake necklace that had been around her neck stared to move . \\n `` oh you must be mistaken dear zeus . \\n i have no plans to submit to anyone . '' \\n lilith gave a wave of her hands as creatures of the damned began to pop up around her instantly . \\n the army behind her was filled with dryads , minotaur 's , furies , and titans . \\n `` this is my last warning baba yaga . \\n submit , and no harm will come to your army . '' \\n baba yaga ? \\n it all started to make sense . \\n during my times in belham , i had often seen lilith covered in jewelry made of bones . \\n i did n't find it strange then , because it was normal for creatures of darkness to have a fascination for bones . \\n she also did n't have matted hair or an odor like legends described her . \\n but she was a witch . \\n such creatures did not exist in pearu . \\n lilith response to the god 's demand was sending the gold snake around her neck at zeus who instantly blocked it . \\n her army charged forward their weapons drawn as the battle commenced . \\n my demos sliced through creatures that i once thought of as my kind . \\n now they were my enemy . \\n astraea jumped from behind me and removing her own sword that had been hidden until now . \\n out the corner of my eye i watch her take on a rogue quickly destroying him in one blow . \\n all of the gods had their swords pulled and locked into battle . \\n astraea removed a bolt from her bracelet and tossed it over to zeus who threw it down at the ground . \\n the ground split into as a few creatures fell down in the hole . \\n my demos glowed blue as it removed the torso of the harpy chilling its insides . \\n my weapons were made exactly for the creatures of darkness . \\n our body temperature was one of high heat -- the coldness embedded in my weapons was our weakness . \\n as i swung my sword up to attack another creature , lilith suddenly appeared in front of me grasping my hand . \\n `` there 's something different about you aristaeus . '' \\n she smiled at me . \\n i struggled to get out of her hold but it was no use . \\n her strength was one that i 'd witness from poseidon . \\n `` you smell of pearu . '' \\n she said sniffing me . \\n `` but there is something else i 've smelled on you . \\n what could it be ? '' \\n i pushed out of lilith hold and swung my sword at her . \\n she bent backwards smoothly as the blow missed her . \\n a scream sounded nearby taking lilith 's eyes off me . \\n seeing her off guard , i removed my jugest and threw it at her . \\n the gold rope circled her twice before the gold fist clamped down on her . \\n lilith shot me an annoyed look and yanked the gold rope pulling me towards her . \\n her hand went around my throat . \\n `` some warrior you are . \\n you are nothing like your father . \\n you are weak . \\n i will do away with you just as i plan to do away with him . '' \\n the thought of lilith harming my father brought forth a rage that was new to me . \\n as her hand clenched my windpipe , i felt my eyes heat up with fire as i stared up at the night sky . \\n the clearness of the night sky instantly shadowed as rain came pouring down . \\n a sharp white flash shot down from the sky striking lilith and knocking us apart . \\n lilith flew into the trees behind her as i flew over to the water my hand clenching my throat . \\n i peered up to see zeus staring at me , his eyes wide with shock . \\n a minotaur noticed the god 's slight distraction and raised a battle axe up at him . \\n `` look out ! '' \\n i screamed . \\n zeus turned around just in time to block the blow . \\n he sent a fist to the minotaur 's chest that sounded like thunder . \\n glancing towards the trees , i could no longer spot lilith within the crowd . \\n i pushed myself up from the ground and stared at my hands . \\n what had happened to me ? \\n how did i call forth lightening when the god of lightening was here with me in battle ? \\n how could i call forth lightening at all ? \\n `` aristaeus ! '' \\n i turned my head to see astraea staring at me . \\n she pointed to the lake . \\n `` go now ! '' \\n i knew she was telling me to get out of here while i still could . \\n the battle was coming to a close with most of the rogue on the ground dead . \\n i ran towards the lake and waded my way to the middle . \\n i glanced back at astraea as she gave me a soft smile . \\n she was n't the only one watching . \\n zeus stared at me with a peculiar expression . \\n not wanting to find out just yet what that expression was about . \\n i dived in the water and disappeared through the portal . \\n eight my head broke the surface of the water , my arms splashing as i fought for breath . \\n the water in my eyes cleared enough so i could figure out exactly i was at . \\n the purple sky and the grassy hills instantly put me at ease . \\n i was home . \\n i was back in pearu . \\n as , i turned in the water i noticed some figures on the beach . \\n my father guards stood posted on beach their weapons at the ready for any type of attack . \\n in the midst of them was my father . \\n deciding to get it over with , i made my way towards the . \\n the water level dropped as i swam until i could walk against the ocean floor . \\n the guards eyed me as i sloshed towards my father . \\n my father sat on a quilted blanket , his legs folded , his hands entwined and his eyes closed . \\n he was in his meditative stance . \\n `` father . '' \\n my father 's eyes opened slowly , the purple glow in his eyes the opposite than it was yesterday . \\n there was no calm or anger in his eyes -- instead they were mass of blankness . \\n immediately , i dropped down to my knees to seek forgiveness . \\n it hit me now that i had run with information that should have gone to him first . \\n i 'd run from my father like a stranger who did n't trust him . \\n i 'd run from an ally into the hands of an enemy bringing forth what could have been my death . \\n i did n't want to think about how kiowa and dyos would feel if i 'd gotten myself killed today . \\n i 'd realized all of this now , a little too late . \\n `` forgive me , your highness . '' \\n i said speaking again once he did n't say anything . \\n my father eyes stared at me taking in my ripped clothing covered in strays of blood . \\n without speaking , he stood up brushing off stray sands of dirt . \\n he turned on his boots and headed towards the carriage . \\n placing one foot on the step , he turned back and said , `` take him . '' \\n the guards grabbed me by my arms as i let them drag me off to the second carriage that awaited me . \\n broxton stood at the doors , a smile on his face . \\n he was very happy to see me . \\n `` hello there broxton . \\n sorry to disappoint you earlier . '' \\n i said smiling up at him . \\n `` no worries , your highness . \\n i 'll take this opportunity . '' \\n quickly before my father could see , he fist collided with my face , putting me to sleep . \\n i woke some time later in a room that smelled of metal . \\n heat clogged the room making the atmosphere stuffy . \\n i coughed as my eyes roamed the room . \\n they were sore from the blow broxton had dealt me . \\n the little tick was smart enough to use fire behind his punch that not only put me to sleep instantly , but left my eyes and head feeling as if it was on fire . \\n my arms felt strained as they were pulled behind me chained to bolts that led up to the ceiling . \\n my jacket and boots had been removed and thrown on a hook that sat near the door at the front of the room . \\n swallowing against the harshness in my throat , i tried to pull at the chains to see if they would give any leeway but it was no use . \\n `` i am awake . '' \\n i said before launching into a coughing fit . \\n my voice sounded scratchy and it immediately irritated my ears . \\n the door to the room opened as one of my father 's soldier 's wheel in a table covered by a brown skinned cloth . \\n he left the table to the side of the room and did n't bother sparing me a glance . \\n he left out of the room , the door closing with a loud bang . \\n i hung there suspended in the air for what seemed like another hour before the door opened revealing my father . \\n he came in alone , closing the door behind him . \\n the tapping of his boots against the floor in the quiet silence made my body tense up with dread . \\n my father has always been a quiet soul , but today i had never seen anything like his calm . \\n he came to a stop inches away from me , his nose almost touching mine . \\n `` i apologize on the behalf of broxton . \\n he gets a bit overzealous at times when it comes to revenge . '' \\n `` no apologies necessary . \\n i figured at had it coming from heckling him all the time . '' \\n `` as it is , he disobeyed my orders and now shares a chamber on the opposite of yours . '' \\n my father said . \\n for a moment , i felt sorry for broxton , but the fire thumping pain in my head made me think otherwise . \\n `` i 've taken the liberty of having the medic patch you up from your injuries from earlier . '' \\n my father walked over to the hook where my clothes hung and removed the purple blazer he wore . \\n he hung it up on the extra hook and pulled his loose strands of hair that he normally kept down , into a ponytail behind his back . \\n `` those injuries that you obtained , i take it came from when you exited the world of pearu , am i correct ? '' \\n `` father - '' `` answer the question aristaeus , my patience for you is standing on the bridge ready to jump . '' \\n `` yes , your highness . \\n the injuries were the result of me leaving the world of pearu . '' \\n `` thank you for your honesty , young prince . '' \\n the calmness of his voice shook me . \\n something was off here . \\n my father walked over to the table the guard had brought in earlier and removed the cloth tossing it aside to the floor . \\n i could now see what was on the table . \\n i felt my eyes widened with disbelief as they took in the items that were on the table . \\n on the table were weapons from knives and hammers to clear bottles filled with numerous colored liquids . \\n these were items that were used to torture prisoners . \\n i could n't fathom my father using them one me . \\n my mind changed however , when i saw him study the weapons in concentration trying to decide which one he would use first . \\n my father picked up a dagger and a clear bottle that was filled with a yellow liquid . \\n `` father , do not do this . '' \\n i said as he was now nearing me pulling the table along behind him . \\n my father ignored my words as he came to a stop in front of me , the table now at his side . \\n without blinking , he slashed my stomach with the dagger in my hands . \\n i clenched my teeth in pain as my father followed it up by pouring the yellow liquid on the wound . \\n the yellow liquid brought a stinging worst then the cut as i screamed out . \\n i huffed and puffed for a few seconds before the pain numbed a bit allowing me to breathe . \\n `` dragon venom . '' \\n my father said . \\n i stared up at the half smile on his face . \\n it is said to be one thing that the gods themselves fear . \\n it is why they banished them to our land . \\n to avoid being attacked by this creature . '' \\n my father eyes turned from the liquid back to me . \\n `` i guess we are alike in some ways are n't we ? '' \\n `` father , if you let me down i 'll - '' `` in due time . '' \\n he turned to place the liquid back on the table but kept the knife in his hand , twirling it around before letting it pierce his finger . \\n blood bubbled to the surface as he brought it near me and wiped it within my wound . \\n `` maybe now that you have some of my blood in you , you will act as my blood . '' \\n there it was . \\n the cruelty i had been waiting for had finally reared its head . \\n i knew there was no way that i was going to talk my way out of this . \\n this was a punishment my father thought i 'd deserve for disobeying him . \\n it was a punishment that i would have to take . \\n a gleam settled in my father 's eyes as he looked me . \\n `` ah , it seems that we are now starting to understand each other . \\n that is good , because i have some questions for you aristaeus that need to be answered . \\n you will answer them , wo n't you aristaeus ? '' \\n i bothered not to answer him . \\n he knew i had no choice in the matter . \\n proving i was right , he continued on . \\n `` when we last spoke , we talked about the hidden portal in our world . \\n i asked you if the portal was still in the world of the sirens but you claim that it had been moved and you had no idea where to . \\n and yet , you seem to find it quite quickly when you arrived from belham . '' \\n the blade slashed across my left torso as this time my father added some clear liquid to the wound . \\n if i had tears , i knew that my face would be drenched by now with the pain that i was experiencing . \\n `` now tell me aristaeus , did you lie to his majesty the king . '' \\n my father 's voice had taken on the accents of mortals during the renaissance period . \\n he chuckled at his imitation . \\n `` i am waiting . '' \\n `` no , your highness . \\n i did not lie to you . \\n i spoke the truth when i said i did not know the whereabouts of the portal . '' \\n `` you seemed to know something . \\n you headed straight for the ocean as if you were on a mission . '' \\n when i opened my mouth , i did n't hesitate to lie . \\n `` it was just a quick hunch . \\n i figured since the last portal was located in water , then the other big body of water like that of nicolle would be the ocean . '' \\n my father was silent for a moment as we stared at each other . \\n i could feel him smelling the untruth to my words . \\n despite betraying him so that i could run off into the hands of the enemy , i still kept quiet . \\n i did n't feel right confessing what astraea had told me . \\n maybe it was because of what she went through to return me to my world , or maybe it was because of the strong attraction i was starting to have for her . \\n either way , my father could taste the deceit in the air . \\n he just did n't know how to sort out the truth yet . \\n he soon answered my reply by slashing my arm . \\n `` you 've always been a deceitful child . '' \\n he turned and threw the dagger down on the table . \\n `` i was just hoping that in time you would grow out of it . '' \\n raising a foot , he sent a kick to my abdomen as i felt myself being thrown back into the wall . \\n the chains stretched my arms out making the soreness in them double time . \\n i released a groan as my head fell forward . \\n `` why did you go through that portal ? \\n who did you meet on the other side ? '' \\n `` i went there because i thought i would find lilith there . \\n i wanted to corner her and find out what she and eris had planned . '' \\n `` you continue to lie !! '' \\n `` it is the truth father ! '' \\n i yelled back . \\n a blow from my father sent my head into the chains that was holding me up . \\n `` you have done nothing but lied to me since i 've entered this room . \\n i am sick of playing this cat and mouse game with you . '' \\n my father walked up to me and placed a hand over my face . \\n a humming went through me as i felt heaviness in my face . \\n the force that was going through my body made my head feel as if it was too big for my body . \\n `` gomel yahsir-sateus reveal . '' \\n images from the past couple of days flashed before me as if i was watching them on one of those famous mortal screens . \\n they were images of my deepest secrets , fears , and wants . \\n they were images of the time i 'd spent in belham . \\n they were images of astraea . \\n at the sight of her face before me , i instantly tried to block the force my father was using , but there was no stopping him . \\n he was pulling everything that he could from me . \\n it was only when the last image of me arriving back on the beach that made him come to a halt . \\n i dropped completely drained against the chains . \\n i waited for my father to speak on what he 'd seen , but i heard nothing . \\n when the silence became too much for me , i peered up through my lose strands of hair at him . \\n he was staring off to the side with an unfathomable look in his eyes . \\n something he 's seen in my head had him shaken . \\n but what ? \\n i recalled the memory of me calling forth the lightning from the sky . \\n if that 's what had him the way he was now , i could n't blame him . \\n i had yet to come to terms on what i 'd done myself . \\n my father finally looked back towards me . \\n his throat moved as if he was nervous or better yet speechless . \\n without saying another word , he turned on his heels and headed over towards the door . \\n he redressed in his blazer and walked to the door and opened it . \\n `` beat him until he 's unconscious . '' \\n he spoke to the guards outside the room . \\n he exited as the guards entered the room a look of pure happiness on their face . \\n they lived for torture and pleasing their king , even if it meant teaching his spoil brat of a son a lesson . \\n one of the guards wind his hand up and sent a blow to my face once again bringing me to darkness . \\n flashes of different scenery greeted me as i traveled to and out of consciousness . \\n i saw myself being beaten , being removed from the chains , being taken up the stairs , being laid on my bed , and my favorite of all , seeing kiowa leaning over staring into my face . \\n the next time i awoke , i was glad to see that it was n't a dream . \\n kiowa glanced over at me , a mixture of happiness and fury on her face . \\n `` hey you . '' \\n i said trying to push myself up into a sitting position . \\n the sharp pain in my abdomen quickly had me lying back down . \\n `` do not try to get up . \\n the medic said you have a lot of broken bones . \\n you 're not going to be able to move for a while . \\n they really did a number on you . '' \\n `` do n't worry i 'll be fine . \\n i 'm tough . '' \\n `` well in that case . '' \\n kiowa punched me in my stomach as i groaned . \\n i reached up and caught her hand before she could deliver another blow . \\n `` do not stop me aristaeus . \\n i should do much more to you after the trouble you have caused . \\n how dare you consort with the gods ? '' \\n `` what do you mean ? '' \\n `` do not play coy . \\n your father told me everything . \\n i ca n't believe the feelings you have for those mortals and on top of that , the ones you have for that woman god . '' \\n i stared at the anger in kiowa 's face . \\n while she was the nicest creature in pearu i 'd ever known , that still did n't matter when it came to her views of mortals and gods . \\n she was one in the same with every other creature . \\n it was only i who harbored sympathy for them . \\n `` your father is irate over what he seen . '' \\n `` then he should have stayed out of my head . '' \\n i said feeling no remorse now . \\n `` i 'm glad he for once went against your wishes and invaded your thoughts . \\n aristaeus you can not take the throne with thoughts like that . \\n no one in this world will follow you . '' \\n `` good , because i do not want the throne . '' \\n kiowa raised her hand to slap me as i caught it . \\n `` kiowa , i am only going to say this once . \\n do not lay another hand on me . \\n i have been through enough hits tonight . \\n the least you could do is spare me until i 've healed again . '' \\n with that i tossed her hand to the side . \\n `` leave me . \\n i want to rest now . '' \\n i turned my back on her ignoring the hurt look on her face . \\n my body remained tensed as i waited for the movement indicating that she had left . \\n yet , she remained . \\n `` i am just trying to understand aristaeus . \\n what is it that the gods have that you want so dearly ? \\n what is it that makes you have feelings for that girl ? '' \\n `` as of right now , silence . '' \\n kiowa scoffed at my reply . \\n `` and your explanation for the feelings you have for that girl ? '' \\n `` there are no feelings . \\n now please leave . \\n i need my rest . '' \\n kiowa released a huff of annoyance as she got up from my bed . \\n my bedroom door closed with a slam as i finally released the tension . \\n rolling over in my bed , i stared up at the ceiling of my room . \\n it seems i 'd disappointed not only my father , but my kiowa as well . \\n they all seem to think that i 'd betrayed them and gone over to the other side . \\n while they were right about me betraying them , i 've yet to join the gods . \\n despite my attraction to astraea , i still harbored some mild feelings of hatred for them . \\n that part of my demon side i could not deny . \\n closing my eyes , i could now do what i 've wanted to do since i returned home . \\n i called forth the memory of the battle with lilith . \\n lilith was a baba yaga . \\n how could i not sense that she was n't a creature of the damned ? \\n she 'd been living amongst other creatures while in belham , and yet no one picked up on it . \\n i wondered if os ' mar did . \\n is that why he 'd suddenly disappeared ? \\n i thought about the way she 'd sniffed me claiming to smell something different in me than my demon blood . \\n i thought about how she 'd threatened to kill my father and how 'd i called on an unknown power in me that i had no idea that i harbored . \\n not to mention the fact that it was lightening , a power known only to that of zeus . \\n the image of zeus face came to me . \\n he was just as shock as i was . \\n astraea carried all his bolts on the bracelet around her wrist so there was no way i could have snatched one off of her . \\n for some reason i think they only moved at her touch . \\n thinking of astraea , my thoughts switched to her placing a peaceful blanket on me . \\n i pulled together images of her eyes , her hair , her mouth , until the puzzle of her face was completed . \\n i wondered if she 'd gotten home safe . \\n i 'd left so fast that i had no idea on whether or not if she 'd gotten hurt at the scene . \\n i wondered if she would be punished even more harshly because of me . \\n the last thought i wondered before i fell asleep , was if she was thinking of me . \\n the next day at the palace was a tense one . \\n i spent most of my day locked away in my quarters away from the eyes of kiowa and my father . \\n it did n't seem to bother my father much since that meant he could keep an eye on me better . \\n kiowa however , had stopped by plenty times trying to get me to come out . \\n she 'd even resorted to having dyos stopped by . \\n in the end she finally left me to my thoughts as day turned to night . \\n the day after that , i continued the same cycle . \\n it was only two days later that i decided to venture out of the confinements of my room . \\n i walked down the spiral staircase to a quiet palace . \\n it was early in the morning but yet there was no one at the table , in fact some of the servants seemed scarce . \\n a group of guards were posted in the hall and i knew they were meant for me . \\n i ducked behind one of the columns as i tried to figure out a way to get by them . \\n my answer came when i saw a servant coming from the same direction i 'd traveled holding an arm full of blankets . \\n once he was near me , i yanked him behind the column and covered his mouth to mute his scream . \\n i peered around the column to see if we 'd alerted anyone , but the guards were too busy talking . \\n turning back to the servant , i removed my hand and made a motion for him to be silent . \\n now that he knew who 'd grabbed him , he began to calm down . \\n `` young lord , you frightened me . '' \\n he said once he was fully calmed . \\n `` where are my parents ? '' \\n `` the king is having a meeting with the courant in his office while the queen is in her garden having breakfast . \\n shall i tell her that you are up ? '' \\n `` that wo n't be necessary . \\n is dyos still here ? '' \\n `` no young lord , the king sent him home a couple of days ago . \\n he 's called but your highness asked the staff not to give you any messages . '' \\n i frowned at that . \\n father was cutting off any communication and outside information i could get from dyos . \\n he probably thought that i 'd stayed in my quarters because i was angry with him . \\n while that was true , it was n't the reason i 'd stayed locked up . \\n because of the torture i 'd experienced from him , my body needed time to heal . \\n kiowa claimed the medic said it would take a while before i could move again , but she must have forgot that i have suffered broken bones and cuts before and none of them have left me in pain for more than four days . \\n no , i 'm pretty sure the extra days were added on by the king . \\n while experiencing the torture was new , the potions he used were not . \\n in the city of pearu and in belham , those potions were anything the citizens could talk about . \\n there were some farfetched stories about what they could do to you , but it was the ones in belham that rung true . \\n the potion was made to torture our kind , but like all drugs , it does n't take long for it to leave your system and with berry juice i found out it makes it leave quicker . \\n thanks to my father never spending time with the outcasts of pearu , he had no clue of this remedy and the fact that i 'd requested it for the last couple of days instead of my regular brew , did not alert him to anything different . \\n `` listen to me , i need you to contact dyos and tell him that i will meet him at the place where we once touched zeus hand . '' \\n the servant eyes enlarged as he looked nervously around . \\n `` but young lord , the king has asked us to alert him if you try to leave the palace . \\n i ca n't go against the king . \\n i could be sentenced to death . '' \\n `` you will not be going against the king 's orders . \\n i just need you to give me a head start and then you may alert the king . \\n you can even tell him the message i ask you to give to dyos . '' \\n the servant stared at me as his eyes darted over to the guards who were engrossed in their conversation . \\n they had yet to see us but it would n't be long before they made their way in this direction . \\n `` very well sir , i shall do it . '' \\n `` thank you . \\n i will not forget this favor you have shown me . '' \\n the servant seemed to beam at that . \\n it was as if a light switch had gone off in his head that told him somewhere down the line when i am king , his position will no longer be that of a servant . \\n sadly , that would not be happening . \\n he was too easily swayed . \\n there was no room for someone like that in my palace . \\n `` one more favor . '' \\n i said staring at the guards . \\n `` get the guards some medicine . \\n they 're going to need it . '' \\n the servants stared wide eyed at me as i crept between the columns until i was close enough to the guards . \\n standing behind one of the columns , i listened as they talked about the plans they had once they 'd retired off of the money they 'd earned from the king . \\n `` hello comrades . '' \\n i said stepping from behind the column . \\n they all stared at me with confusion at how i had not only crept up on them but the fact that i was speaking to them . \\n it began to register to them that something about this was not right . \\n it was a shame however , that they did not pick up on it soon enough . \\n i sent a kick to the guard in front of me while reaching over to the second guard to neutralize him of his weapons . \\n my second kick went to the guard on my right as they finally snapped out of their slight moment of confusion . \\n the guard that was standing behind the first one i kicked ran towards me with his arms outstretched . \\n i could tell in his eyes that he only wanted to subdue and not harm me . \\n broxton 's act against me and his punishment seemed to put enough fear in the guards to the point where they barely wanted to touch me . \\n be that as it may , it worked in my favor . \\n i ducked as the guard flew over my body into the column behind me knocking him out cold . \\n the first guard i 'd kicked was back up as he tried to latch onto my neck to put me to sleep . \\n i quickly escaped his grasp and stole his idea making him go to sleep instead . \\n finally all the guards were down . \\n i stared back to where the servant was holding on to the column , probably afraid that i might try to attack him as well . \\n `` go ! '' \\n i ordered . \\n `` call dyos and deliver my message . \\n after that go to the king . \\n by the time you reach the king , i will be off the palace grounds by then . '' \\n the servant nodded and took off down the hall the main center of the palace leaving the blankets he 'd been holding earlier on the ground . \\n i made my way over to the window and pulled back the drapes . \\n pushing open the glass , i climbed up onto the stone and stared out at the landscape . \\n below me was a body of water that came from the ocean . \\n i took one more glance back at the unconscious guards and leaped out of the window into the water that awaited me below . \\n the water let out a huge splash as my body floated towards the bottom . \\n before it could sink to far , i pushed my way to the surface and swam towards the hill bank in the distance . \\n since i 'd given the order to have the bridge pulled up , there was no way that i could cross it and make my escape easier . \\n i had no choice but to swim in the water and chance being caught by the different creatures that guarded the palace . \\n as it were , lucks seemed to be on my side as i made it through the water over to the grassy hill bank . \\n i pulled out the water onto the hill bank and took off with demon speed far away from the palace the slight sound of a horn being blown behind me . \\n nine `` aristaeus ! '' \\n i opened my eyes and stared to side at the sight of dyos running towards me . \\n i had long reached our hiding spot after ducking and hiding around corners away from the prying eyes of the citizens of pearu and my father 's army . \\n he 'd reacted quicker than i expected sending the very same guards i dispatched earlier after me . \\n this was their punishment for losing me in the first place i assumed . \\n i felt a slight feeling of pity because here they would lose me again . \\n once i was back in the palace , i would speak on their behalf to save them from being removed from duty . \\n it was the least i could do for causing them problems . \\n `` you 're late . '' \\n i said once dyos was standing a few feet away from me . \\n `` whatever , do you have any idea how hard it is to escape the eyes of the general . \\n if only you 'd given me some time to prepare , i could have had a great escape plan . '' \\n `` in dire times , you do not have time to prepare an escape plan . \\n you only need to escape . '' \\n dyos scoffed . \\n `` dire times you say . \\n and what about today would be dire enough for you to anger the king by leaving the palace this time ? '' \\n i stood up from my spot where i lay . \\n opening the brown blazer jacket that would help hide me from my father , i showed dyos the scars that were left by his dear king . \\n dyos gasped as he stepped forward . \\n his hand reached out as if to touch the scars but drew back . \\n anger glowed in his eyes as he turned his head from me . \\n `` did he do that to you ? '' \\n `` i assumed you knew , since you came to the palace those days . '' \\n dyos shook his head as his hands clenched . \\n `` kiowa told me nothing of this . \\n she only said that your father and you had another disagreement and that this time you 'd locked yourself in your quarters . \\n i figured you just needed some time to sort through your anger . \\n if i 'd known aristaeus , i would have done something . \\n i ... i would n't have left you there . '' \\n `` what could you have done dyos ? \\n had you risen up against my father , it would have been the end for not only you but the general as well . \\n do not worry . \\n i 'm healing fine despite my father 's thoughts . \\n as for kiowa , she is a bit angry and embarrassed . \\n her slight betrayal can be overlooked . '' \\n the two of us were silent for a moment before dyos spoke again . \\n `` why is it that we needed to meet here ? \\n i almost forgot about this place to tell you the truth . \\n i have n't been here since we were kids . '' \\n `` that is why i asked you to come . '' \\n i stared around at the darken forest that was once the land of the giants . \\n after eris was dethroned , the giants felt no loyalty to the new king and decided to take their kind elsewhere . \\n myths traveled to the city that they 'd taken up inhabitation of the forests killing any creature that came in perimeter of it . \\n the myths were like bedtime stories to us , so when dyos and i became of age , we went on a hunt to discover for ourselves . \\n however , when we arrived there were no giants . \\n the land was bare and marred by black soot . \\n the only thing that seemed to intrigue us was the outline of a handprint on the forest grounds . \\n there was no sun in pearu so we were stomped on the golden light of the hand shining through the trees , and when we looked up through the trees , instead of seeing the handprint , we saw a lightning bolt instead . \\n it was then we 'd come to think of this as zeus handprint . \\n we 'd come back every time we were together to shake his hand , and beg the gods for forgiveness , and then we grew up . \\n `` it is a place the king will not dare to look for us at . '' \\n i continued . \\n `` he 's probably having the ocean searched thoroughly by now . '' \\n `` what happened yesterday aristaeus ? \\n you told me you were going to see someone , i did n't think you were going to leave pearu to see that somebody . \\n i almost had what those mortals call a heart attack when your father questioned me on our return from belham . \\n he put guards on me and everything . '' \\n i kept quiet trying to decide on how much to tell dyos . \\n i wanted to tell him everything , but i was afraid . \\n i was afraid he would view me the same as my father and kiowa had when they 'd learn about my communication with astraea and the secret power i 'd seemed to have . \\n but i needed someone on my side . \\n i needed someone from my world on my side . \\n `` come one aristaeus . '' \\n dyos said staring over at me . \\n `` we 've been friends for way too long . \\n whatever is going on , you can tell me . '' \\n he spoke as if he 'd just read my mind . \\n he spoke again . \\n `` besides you owe me . '' \\n he was right . \\n he 'd suffered much from my father because of my escape to see astraea . \\n my father could only take so much before he retaliated against me by using dyos . \\n though he did n't seem to possess any bruises close to mine , i 'm sure my father had left his mark on him somewhere and it was nothing the general could do about that . \\n `` you 're right my friend . \\n i 'll tell you everything . '' \\n dyos lay on the forest ground , his jacket covered in soot , but it did n't seem to bother him . \\n he stared up through the opening of the trees where the light resembled a lightning bolt . \\n he stared past it towards the purple of pearu 's sky . \\n i sat off to the side of him leaned up against a tree picking at a dead dragon lilly , waiting for him to speak to me again . \\n i 'd just laid my entire story on him hoping he would be the one in three that would not turn his back on me . \\n it was funny to me . \\n a demon , leaning against a tree , hoping to still have a friend . \\n `` is she pretty ? '' \\n `` what ? '' \\n i asked looking up . \\n `` is she pretty ? \\n this astraea creature . '' \\n `` why does that matter ? '' \\n dyos turned towards me giving me a hard blank stare . \\n `` it matters . '' \\n we stared at each other for a moment before i finally said , `` yeah , she 's pretty . '' \\n dyos nodded and turned back towards the sky . \\n i could see him battling with himself and i felt even more distressed that i was the one making him this way . \\n i could say what i wanted about my father and kiowa , but they were just being true to themselves . \\n they were creatures of the damned . \\n they despise mortals and gods . \\n it was only i , who seemed to be different . \\n `` okay it 's settled then . '' \\n dyos said leaping to his feet . \\n `` what 's settled ? '' \\n `` we 've got to find out more about lilith . \\n a witch in our world is unheard of and the whole thing reeks of danger . \\n the fact that this baba yaga is interested in you , does n't sit right . \\n no offense , you 're nothing more than just the prince . \\n it is true that in order for eris to take the throne lilith would have to wipe out your entire bloodline . \\n but she could do that inside the gates of pearu . \\n why travel to the mortal world where you just so happened to be having a conversation with astraea ? \\n it 's like she 's watching you . \\n plus , it rubs me the wrong way how she claims you smell different . \\n i 've been around you my whole life , and you 've always smell the same to me . \\n but she 's not from here . \\n her sense of smell could be stronger than mine . \\n the fact that she 's picked up on something worries me . '' \\n i stood up happy that i for once had someone on my side . \\n i walked over to stand beside him . \\n `` i thought i would be the only one worrying about that as well , but when my father read my thoughts , he seemed just as confused and freaked out as i was . \\n maybe that 's why he ordered the guards on me . \\n he probably assumed he could beat whatever it was out of me . '' \\n `` i usually live for the king 's cruelty , but not this time . \\n is that against the character of my kind ? '' \\n `` look who you 're asking . \\n i 'm a sympathizer for mortals and have the eyes for a female who whose kind have confined my kind to one world , and i have the power to call forth lightning bolts from the sky . \\n i am no longer from the same cloth of my kind . '' \\n `` nonsense aristaeus . \\n you might be a little tweaked in the head but what reaper would n't be . \\n i 'm sure you 're not the first of our world to feel for mortals . '' \\n even as he said it , we both knew it was n't true . \\n the glance out the corner of his eye seemed to prove it . \\n clearing his throat he said , `` you 're just feeling sorry for yourself . '' \\n `` you 're right . \\n so what course of action should we take ? '' \\n `` first we need to read up more about eris and her time as queen here in pearu . \\n since it was before our time , we 'll have to search the archives . \\n they 're a bit hush about her , so it wo n't be easy finding anything right off the top . '' \\n `` i agree . \\n they probably have them stored in a secret compartment . '' \\n `` that is if they have n't burned everything . '' \\n `` they 're not allowed to . \\n it 's in the bylaws that all information from every reign should be passed down to the next ruler just in case another case from the past shall arise . '' \\n i said thinking about the numerous times the trainers had drilled that information into my head . \\n `` if there is any information , it would be kept somewhere close to the king . \\n somewhere within his reach . '' \\n `` you think it 's in the palace ? '' \\n i nodded . \\n dyos clapped his hands . \\n `` well that 's one thing taken care of . \\n i think we should also have a copy of their battle plans just in case . \\n we might have to warn your girlfriend . '' \\n `` she 's not my girlfriend , and we 're not telling them anything . \\n not until we 're absolutely sure of everything . \\n i have to make sure ... i have to make sure before i betray my father . '' \\n the words hung in the air . \\n dyos stared over at me picking up on what i was n't saying . \\n i needed to know if the feelings i had for astraea were true and not something of a charmed spell . \\n i 'd only met her twice , i had no clue whether if this was love or if she 'd even felt the same way . \\n if i went against my father , i would be out casting myself and turning against my kind for the sky gods who may not show the same courtesy one of their fellow gods may have shown me . \\n i still did n't forget that i 'd already gotten on poseidon 's bad side . \\n plus zeus was wary of me after the battle with lilith . \\n as my father stated before , i could n't go into this without thinking clearly . \\n i needed to be sure . \\n `` be careful looking for those battle plans . \\n i 'm sure the general is guarding them with his life since his life may be at stake in they get into the wrong hands . '' \\n `` do n't worry . \\n i know how to distract my father well enough . \\n just worry about your own . '' \\n `` they 'll question us as soon as we get back . \\n did you bring it with you ? '' \\n dyos reached into his coat pocket and removed the two blue vials . \\n `` we 're lucky i remembered we used to bring these whenever we came here . \\n i 'm almost out . \\n i 'll need to get some more from the city . '' \\n he held the vials in his hand as i pulled out two pieces of parchment paper . \\n on the paper i wrote , today , i traveled to a land where i 'd once touched the hand of zeus . \\n in that land i met a dear friend of mine . \\n we spoke of my troubles and with the revealing , he remained that of a friend . \\n we then toasted our friendship with a drink that washed away the troubles knowing only the waves of the tide could bring it back . \\n we said our farewells and then parted ways . \\n he to be a knight and i to be a king . \\n i repeated the same lines on the other piece of parchment paper before rolling them up into thin tubes . \\n i stuck mine into the hilt of my demos as dyos stuck his in the crest of his necklace . \\n dyos handed me one of the vials . \\n `` see you in a couple of days . '' \\n `` the same to you . '' \\n water struck my face , waking me from the darkness that seemed to surround me . \\n water droplets ran down my face into my opened mouth as i took pleasure in it against the dryness of my mouth . \\n squinting my eyes , i stared up through my damp hair to see my father 's guards in front of me . \\n my eyes roamed around the room i was in . \\n i was in a bar and had no idea how i 'd gotten here . \\n `` hello comrades . '' \\n i grinned up at them rolling onto my back . \\n someone groaned behind me making me peer back . \\n dyos lay behind me on the floor , his jacket covered in whatever beverage he 'd been drinking . \\n he stared up at me through squinted eyes as i smiled , `` well if it is n't my good friend dyos . \\n did we go and get ourselves in trouble again ? '' \\n dyos reply was a laugh that in turn sent me into a fit of giggles . \\n `` get them up , '' ordered one of the guards as he stared down at us in disgust . \\n he then turned to the bartender . \\n `` i thought you said these two never crossed your threshold . \\n how dare you lie in front of the king 's men ! '' \\n the bartender 's eyes grew wide with fear . \\n `` i did not lie ! \\n they were n't here when you came . \\n they just stumbled in grabbing whatever drinks that were at their disposal . \\n by the way , who is going to pay for those drinks and the damage they caused . '' \\n the guard waved away the bartender as i felt myself being yanked up by the guards . \\n `` easy cronies . \\n do you know how much this fabric cost ? \\n ten dragon scales . '' \\n dyos cackled with laughter again as his own guards yanked him up . \\n `` take him to the general . '' \\n the head guard said . \\n `` this one is going with us . \\n the king awaits him . '' \\n i felt myself being pulled in the opposite direction of dyos as we exited the bar to the two carriages that were waiting for us . \\n the guard threw me as my head knocked against the wall of the carriage . \\n he hopped in across from me closing the door as the words of the bar tender fussing about payment of the drinks , were drowned out . \\n the carriage jerked to a start as i felt the nausea of the drinks i downed roll around in my stomach waiting to break the surface . \\n i tried to force myself up but the unsteady movement of the carriage knocked me back down . \\n the guard across from me scoffed as i grinned . \\n `` jealous , you ca n't have this much fun . '' \\n `` no fun is worth the wrath of the king . '' \\n `` loser . '' \\n the guard did n't bother to respond to my elementary school insult . \\n closing my eyes i tried to pull up memories on how i arrived at the bar , but kept coming up blank . \\n the last thing i remembered was going to bed last night . \\n i had no clue on leaving my room and meeting dyos at a bar . \\n i guess the drinks really did a number on us . \\n but that did n't make sense . \\n we 've never gotten this totaled over a few drinks at the bar before . \\n there had to be something else . \\n but i could n't pull it up . \\n i did n't have time to ponder anymore about it as the carriage had reached the palace . \\n the door to the carriage opened as the blurry image of my father standing in the doorway stared at me . \\n i formed a lopsided smile as his frown seemed to deepen . \\n `` get him of there and take him to my study . '' \\n the guards tripped over their feet trying to please the king as they pulled me from the carriage . \\n they carried me with care passed the servants and a worried kiowa . \\n we reached the study and the guards placed me in one of the chairs . \\n `` bring him something for this hangover . '' \\n `` yes , your highness . '' \\n the doors closed with a slam as i groaned from the impact it left on me . \\n i peered up through the slits of my eyes at my father who was sitting in the chair opposite me . \\n grinning i said , `` hi daddy . '' \\n my father 's eyes widened and i had to choke back a laugh at the shock he faced at me using the words of mortals . \\n there was even a slight hint of blush on his face that was unusual for not only him but our kind as well . \\n it only happened when we were truly taken by surprise , like he was right now . \\n i could n't wait to tell dyos this -- that is if i remember it . \\n he finally brought himself back to control . \\n `` this is the reason i wish for you to stay out of the mortal world . \\n you 're bringing back the foolishness of the mortal world and contaminating our world with it . \\n i wo n't have it . '' \\n i mumbled something incoherently against the cushion of the chair which seemed to annoy him even more . \\n `` you have yet to learn the repercussion of your actions aristaeus . \\n you were spotted out in the city rolling around on the ground like a mortal drunkard . \\n you continue to bring shame to this family and disobeying my authority with your constant defiance . \\n how do you think that makes me look as king if i ca n't even control my own son ? \\n it makes me look weak , and it makes you look like a fool . \\n no one will stand for you taking the throne when your time comes if you continue to be this way . \\n these are dark times aristaeus and the darkest hour is approaching . \\n the rogue is gathering more followers to take over our world and the only thing you seem keen on doing is creating havoc . '' \\n i pushed up from lying in the chair . \\n the remnants of the alcohol left my head heavy but i forced myself to remain sitting up . \\n `` forgive me father , i did n't mean to cause any more stress for you . \\n i guess i was just thinking about trying to erase the memory of you torturing your only son from my mind . \\n maybe i should have told the locals about that . \\n it could have gave you the harsh appearance you so desire . '' \\n `` where did you and dyos go ? '' \\n `` should n't you know ? \\n you had your lackey 's come and capture us there . '' \\n `` my patience for you aristaeus is running thin . \\n i know you and dyos went somewhere besides the bar . \\n the servant told me he overheard you speaking to dyos on the phone about meeting at the place where you touch the hand of zeus . \\n did you leave this world again ? '' \\n my brows furrowed as i stared across at my father in confusion . \\n `` what are you talking about ? '' \\n `` you tell me aristaeus . '' \\n `` i 'm telling you father , i do not know what you are talking about . \\n dyos and i did n't go anywhere besides the bar . \\n are you sure the servant was n't pulling the wool over your eyes ? '' \\n my father stared at me as i stared back . \\n i had no memory of going anywhere besides the bar with dyos . \\n but the fact that my father knew of the secret hideout dyos and i use to venture to spoke some truth to his words . \\n that could only mean one thing . \\n we 'd taken a vial to erase our memory . \\n the reason we were there must have been of importance and whatever we 'd discussed we could not let anyone find out . \\n the potion we 'd drunken must have been enough to erase only the memory of today , which is why i could still remember last night . \\n i saw my father move out the corner of my eye as he walked over to me . \\n i stared up at him as he stared down at me , his eyes roaming my face . \\n `` your memory has been erased . '' \\n he did n't wait for me to confirm as he placed his hand on my head . \\n the pain in my head from the alcohol was already enough , but with the radiating power of my father , it throbbed ten times worst . \\n my teeth clenched together as memories from last night came forward in front of my eyes . \\n when it got to today however , there was only blackness . \\n it was as if i 'd passed out or simply gone to sleep . \\n it went on like that for a couple of seconds before the memory of waking up in the bar shot forward . \\n my father let go of my head and stepped back . \\n he peered down at me as i reached up to grab my head . \\n `` someone erased your memory of your travels earlier . \\n think aristaeus , did you and dyos go anywhere besides the bar , did you meet anyone else besides dyos ? '' \\n i pretended to think . \\n `` i 'm not sure father . \\n i ca n't pull up anything . \\n i 'm trying . '' \\n my father turned his back to me as he walked off a few steps . \\n his hands came behind his back and his head bowed . \\n i knew what he was thinking . \\n he was thinking that i 'd probably run into eris and that she 'd done something to me . \\n it was no need to tell him any different . \\n he walked over to the phone in next to his chair and picked up the receiver . \\n `` this is king kavos , bring me dyos immediately . '' \\n he placed the receiver back down and turned to me . \\n `` what are you thinking ? '' \\n `` do not worry yourself aristaeus . \\n if dyos memory like yours is gone , i will have my answer to whom have done this to you . '' \\n i nodded as my thoughts moved over to vial i 'd taken . \\n `` father , do you think you can have the servants bring me some starfish . '' \\n `` certainly . '' \\n `` do n't cook it ! '' \\n i shouted it at the last minute . \\n my father glanced over at me . \\n `` i 'm just really hungry and i do n't have time to cook it . \\n besides i like the taste of tide water in it . '' \\n my father stared at me with confusion but still made the call . \\n it did n't take long for the servants to arrive with the tray . \\n they removed the top covering the bowl where the golden brown starfish lay breathing in the soup of tide water . \\n i gathered some of the tide water and dripped it over the starfish when my father 's phone rung . \\n `` speak . '' \\n he answered into the receiver . \\n i played with my food trying to find a way to stall time when he stood up from his chair . \\n `` do not let any of them get away ! \\n i will be there shortly . '' \\n my father slammed the receiver down as the scales on his face popped up . \\n someone had agitated him . \\n `` what 's going on ? '' \\n he stared at me for a moment as if trying to decide whether if he could trust me or not . \\n clearing his throat he said , `` the rogue has struck again . \\n prince famar is dead . '' \\n i stared at him , my face impassive . \\n i knew it would n't be long before she struck again . \\n i also found myself not caring that famar was dead . \\n he was a nuisance . \\n the only thing that worried me was who would be her next target . \\n `` i have to leave the palace for a while . \\n tell dyos to stay put until i get back . \\n the same goes for you . '' \\n with that he walked past me , his coattail brushing my arm as he exited the study . \\n i gave him a couple of minutes before removing the hilt of my demos . \\n i unrolled the parchment paper and read the lines written in my handwriting . \\n my father was telling the truth . \\n dyos and i had met today . \\n we 'd spoke in confidence and i needed to know about what . \\n i swallowed the piece of parchment down my throat and removed the starfish from the bowl drinking the tide water that was in the bowl . \\n once it was all gone , i picked up the starfish and squeezed it over my mouth gathering the water it had soaked up . \\n finished , i tossed it to the side and sat back as my memory slowly came together . \\n flashes of attacking the guards , jumping out the window into the water around the palace , hiding from the guards , arriving at the land of the giants , talking with dyos , and drinking the vials , it all came back to me . \\n standing up from the chair , i stared around the room of my father 's study with a smile on my face . \\n it worked . \\n thanks to the rogue , i was allowed to search the palace without the wandering eyes of my father . \\n i was allowed to search not just any part of the palace , but a place where i knew the hidden scrolls of eris would be . \\n his study . \\n ten the moment i heard the carriages pull away from the palace , i leaped into action . \\n walking over to the doors of my father 's study , i opened them and peered out into the hallway . \\n two guards sat in the chairs outside of my father 's study taking a lunch break . \\n they did n't seem to worry about the fact that i was left alone in the king 's study . \\n they were still under the impression that i was intoxicated and the only harm i would bring would be to myself . \\n i 'm sure my father gave them orders to let me rest until all the alcohol was out of my system , but i did n't doubt that the moment i left this room , i would be flanked by guards . \\n i closed the door back silently , and slowly latched the lock . \\n staring around the room , i tried to figure out where exactly to start my search . \\n there were no visible doorways or windows , and the only objects in the room were the chairs we 'd been sitting in . \\n if there was information in this room about eris , it was hidden , but my only question was where ? \\n starting off on the right side of the room , i ran my hand across the wall as i checked for any switches or movable blocks . \\n the stones that made up the wall had no cracks or painted on symbols . \\n they looked as if they 'd just been built today . \\n i moved over towards the glass window that housed the souls . \\n the amount of souls had decreased since the last time i visited . \\n since the last time i was in belham . \\n since the gates of the damned were broken . \\n without the damned souls of the mortals , the world of pearu would cease to exist . \\n the souls were our oxygen , without the souls , our kind will become extinct . \\n i continued to search the room but still came up empty . \\n there was nothing here . \\n i 'd search every inch of this room from the walls to the floors but could not find not one movable piece or any type of switch . \\n feeling defeated , i plopped down in the chair pushing aside the cart with the uneaten starfish . \\n i did n't understand it . \\n i thought for sure that if there was any information on eris that my father wanted to keep hidden , it would be in this study . \\n his study was like his safe haven . \\n when he was n't entertaining guests or having meetings with the courant , he was in his study , trapped in his thoughts . \\n i 've always thought that there was a hidden room inside this study , but i guess i was wrong . \\n as i sat there and tried to figure other places in the palace where the information could be hidden , my eyes swept across my father 's throne chair . \\n at first glance , nothing seemed out of the ordinary . \\n it was like any other one of this throne chairs . \\n but as i stared at the skulls on the hand of the chair , something seemed off . \\n the two silver skulls were lighting the souls as usual . \\n however , the skull on the right side of the chair mouth was wider than the one of the left . \\n closing my eyes , i pictured my father sitting in the chair , his hands stretched out along the arms of the chair , his left hand covering the skull while his right circled the top of the skull 's head as if he was avoiding the mouth . \\n opening my eyes , i got up from the chair and walked over to chair . \\n i turned to face the chair i 'd been sitting as i lowered into it . \\n here goes nothing . \\n reaching my right arm out , my fingers darted around the skull before finally curling in its mouth . \\n my fingers tapped against a switch inside the mouth . \\n this is it ! \\n i could feel it . \\n this switch would open the hidden room . \\n without wasting time , my fingers squeezed the button . \\n there was no loud groaning or dust particles falling down from the ceiling , the chair simply descended underground . \\n it was a smooth transition . \\n the chair seemed to go on forever before coming to a stop . \\n the room was completely dark that even my night vision could n't detect any objects or movement around me . \\n it was n't until i pushed up from the chair and my boots connected with the floor , that a little light came on . \\n the light came from above and below me . \\n i took a step forward , and more switches of light came on . \\n when i was four steps away from the chair , it suddenly lifted back up towards the ceiling encasing me back in the darkness . \\n thankfully , the further i walked , the more light illuminated . \\n i could hear water dropping on the sides of me and knew that the ground i was walking on was some kind of bridge . \\n one false move and i would fall over into unknown waters . \\n i had no idea how my father handled this type of blind walking . \\n maybe he was prepared with a light when he came down here . \\n i soon came to find out that i did n't need a light . \\n the lights from my steps had now lightened the room so i could see around me . \\n i was in a cave . \\n i was also right about there being water in this room . \\n dark murky water ran alone the sides of the narrow light bridge i had been walking on . \\n i tried to peer through the water to see if anything was in it , but gave up . \\n the water was as dark as tar . \\n i had to remind myself why i was down here and it was n't to explore the murky waters under the floor of my father 's study . \\n pushing on , i continued down the bridge until i reached an archway , the bridge descending into steps . \\n awe struck my face the moment i stepped through the archway . \\n the first thing i noticed was how massive this room was . \\n it was the size of my entire quarters and it seemed to stretch even further . \\n the second thing that i noticed was the enormous amount of currency in this room . \\n from where i was standing i could see the etchings of not only the dragon scale currency from our world , but the different currency that was used in the mortal world . \\n how did my father get all of this down here without anyone noticing ? \\n was this his own little secret , or did the courant know about this hidden chamber as well . \\n did it belong to eris ? \\n the cavern walls seemed old enough to be around the time she reigned . \\n what about kiowa ? \\n i 'm pretty sure she had no clue about this room either . \\n entering the room , i took my attention off of the currency and stared around at the structure of the cavern . \\n two sets of stairs curved to the side that connected to a bridge above me . \\n the further i looked up , the more bridges i seen . \\n i counted a total of six . \\n on the walls surrounding the currency were shelves filled with books , parchment papers , and statues . \\n i headed over to the wall , my legs struggling through the currency . \\n there was no path for me to walk on so i had to make due with walking through the currency that was now falling over . \\n i just hoped father did n't notice the misplaced currency on his next visit down here . \\n i reached the first wall with the shelves and removed a stained orange colored book . \\n there were n't any letters on the cover to tell me the title so i had to open the book . \\n flipping through the beige colored pages and black ink , the book was nothing more than a book on giants . \\n i placed the book back in its place and moved on to the next one . \\n one by one i searched the books as they all covered the many creatures of pearu . \\n the ink was written in only my father 's hand which i found a bit strange . \\n you would think that eris would document these things during her reign , but not once did i see her handwriting . \\n maybe she had another method for keeping track of the many creatures and events in pearu . \\n i 'd gone through two shelves of parchments and books until i finally found something on eris . \\n while the other books had a bit of discolor to it , this one was completely worn . \\n the pages were a bit dent from someone 's fingers as they read the book what appears to be numerous times . \\n i shuffled some of the currency over with my feet as i squatted down on the floor near the shelves . \\n staring at my father 's handwriting , i began to read . \\n decemris , 10th , year of eris today , i have received great news . \\n i have been assigned as an aide to queen eris . \\n this journey will mark a new one for my family as i serve the great queen . \\n with this position , i will be able to provide my family with a life of luxury instead of a life of thievery . \\n no more will we have to barter for food and goods . \\n the queen has assured me of this . \\n with this position , i will do my best to please the queen and not bring dishonor to my family . \\n i plan to document my entire journey in this journal so that i will have sensational stories for my parents when i return . \\n this is the beginning of a good life . \\n janis 3rd , year of eris i have miscalculated the great queen eris . \\n she is not the one we all so treasured , she is deranged . \\n today , i watched her set loose a giant on an entire family of dryads just because she did not like the sight of their flower garden outside their home . \\n she shouted that they were sympathizers of the mortal world to the crowd of bystanders so they would rally behind her as she committed sins of evil . \\n as her aide , only i knew the truth . \\n i always knew the truth . \\n our queen always committed these acts against our citizens without proper reason . \\n the world of pearu was just as the mortals had pictured , it was hell . \\n the only rules we lived by was eris cruel ones . \\n i could not blame the citizens of pearu however . \\n they were just keeping true to their kind . \\n i guess after venturing into the mortal world and despite the hatred feel for them , they have taught me one thing , how a country should be ran . \\n i will try to have hope that eris will come to see the truth and stop this madness before it is too late . \\n the journal continued to document my father 's time as eris aide . \\n every entry there was something new about eris and the cruelty she was showing upon those of the mortal world . \\n i 'd read a total of twelve pages before coming upon something intriguing . \\n maris 20th , year of eris my hands are shaking as i document this down . \\n eris , eris is creating the powers of the gods . \\n at least , that is what i am trying to tell myself . \\n today , i followed her and a member of the rogue , as they traveled into a part of pearu where we were n't allowed . \\n upon her orders , all creatures of pearu lived near the palace so that she could keep a watchful eye on us . \\n so i did not understand why she was traveling outside the land where no one ventured . \\n but i came to find out why . \\n i 'd been working for eris for centuries now , yet for some reason she has lost trust in me . \\n i 've tried to hide my real feelings towards her , but maybe she has figured me out . \\n as it were , she hired a new aide and together the two spent many days and nights locked away in her quarters plotting , and leaving the palace without guards . \\n it was only today , that i could not stand it any longer and decided to follow her . \\n i followed behind them , cloaking myself up in trees , as they made their way to a shack in the middle of the forest . \\n it was when i peeked through the window , that i saw eris shooting a blue light out of her hand . \\n her aide sat in a chair across from her twisting as the blue light attacked him . \\n one by one she called forth powers that i 've never seen in pearu before . \\n the whole time the aide sat there taking it all until she was finished . \\n i listened to eris complain about not having the full power down yet . \\n the aide assure her that the `` source '' had said it would take time for her learn the magic 's of darkness . \\n she would need to capture more mortal souls so that she could finally gain the full amount of power she was after . \\n the aide reminded her that they had to be careful of the souls so not to alert zeus and samr . \\n i had no clue whom samr was but it was enough to make eris scowl . \\n eris replied that in time she would soon have enough power to kill not only this samr but zeus as well . \\n then she turned towards the window as if she 'd seen me and smiled . \\n it was then that i ran as fast as i could . \\n i could hear someone after me and knew that death awaited me , but as i listened to the speed of the running , it was the rogue , not eris . \\n withdrawing my sword , i turned around in the nick of time , as my sword slashed cleanly through aide cutting him into two . \\n i stared through the forest but eris was n't there . \\n i had to get to the gates before she got to me . \\n strangely , i reached the gates unharmed . \\n venturing outside it , i called forth zeus . \\n when he arrived , i was in awe . \\n i had never seen the god before for he and the others did not show themselves to us . \\n i had begun to think they were nothing but a myth , but as he stood in front of me , i knew different . \\n dropping down to my knees , i confessed to him what i 'd seen . \\n he 'd listened patiently and then said he would take care of it . \\n as he turned to leave , i begged him to hide my family somewhere safe . \\n i feared that eris would go after them to get to me . \\n he promised to keep them and safe as he disappeared leaving me alone . \\n filled with fear that eris would find me , i held up at a friend 's place who shared my views on the queen . \\n after zeus rid pearu of eris , then i would leave this room . \\n until then , i have to remain hidden . \\n maris 25th , year2 of eris he did not keep his promise . \\n she found them . \\n she killed them . \\n he claimed to be sorry . \\n he left . \\n maris 27th , year2 of eris eris has fled . \\n i have been appointed as king of pearu . \\n with her disappearance , the rogue and others have left to join her while others boycott my reign . \\n only a few support me . \\n apros 3rd , year of priam i have learned that eris has sent zobyverth korfmann to the mortal world to create trouble . \\n the killing of innocent jews is sure to attract the attention of zeus . \\n i fear the punishment we will suffer because of her actions . \\n i must take control of the reigns before it is too late . \\n i have been trying to find information on this samr , but have come up short . \\n no one knows of her , which means she must be a higher up god . \\n apros 15th year of priam the anger i feel at the moment can not be explained through mere words on paper though i shall try . \\n zeus has closed the gates of pearu to the mortal world . \\n he has banished us to our world due to the actions of eris who is still missing along with members of her company . \\n i tried to reason with him that it was not my citizens , but he did not care to hear . \\n he wore the same look of blankness he did when he learned of my parents deaths . \\n he did not care for those of pearu and would like nothing more than to see us perish . \\n i once thought of him to be something different , someone i could look upon , but the confusion has been cleared . \\n he and other gods like him are the enemy . \\n once i am done with exterminating eris from this world , i will make it my duty to get rid of him as well . \\n we do not need gods to govern us and tell us when we can and ca n't enter the mortal world . \\n i will not take this as king . \\n i will abide by his rules for now , but in time he will forget , and in that time , i will strike . \\n novembos 2 , year of priam it has been a while since i last wrote in you . \\n the duties of a king of damned creatures can be quite demanding . \\n i have finally installed new laws that will keep the citizens in pearu under control while we are trapped in our world . \\n there were some who disagreed at first , but they have fallen in line like the others . \\n my search for eris is still a long going one . \\n i have searched every part of this world and she is still missing . \\n i have a feeling that she is no longer in this world . \\n the communication from the gods has let me know that she has not perished in death , which leaves me uneasy . \\n where exactly could she be hiding that even the gods ca n't see her ? \\n sometimes i wonder if she ever mastered the skills i 'd once seen her possessed . \\n the magic 's of the darkness . \\n i have created a group of members named the courant -- together we will test every potion in our world to see if we can possess the skill that eris used . \\n however , not all news is bad news . \\n i am married now . \\n my wife , kiowa is a hell demon though sometimes i feel she is a siren from the way she traps me with her smile . \\n due to the rumors floating around , i know she believes that i only married her to settle my seat as king , but it is not true . \\n the feelings i have for her i ca n't explain . \\n we also have a son . \\n kiowa had been trying to give birth to a successful child , but failed . \\n after nine times , she decided to give up . \\n it was then a member of the courant bought her a newborn hell demon to raise as her own . \\n grethen never told me exactly where he got the newborn , only to love it as if he was my biological son , and so i shall . \\n i flipped to the next page , but it was blank . \\n there was no more writing in this book from my father . \\n closing the book , i leaned against the shelf behind me . \\n the shock of what i read hit me . \\n i always knew that i was n't kiowa 's biological son , but it never crossed my mind that i was n't my father 's actual son either . \\n i always thought that my father had married before kiowa , and that woman would be my mother . \\n but i was wrong . \\n i was just a newborn gift to him and he did not let me think any different . \\n i felt anger stir in me from not knowing the truth earlier . \\n what about my real parents ? \\n it was obvious that my father never cared to know who they were . \\n he trusted this grethen . \\n my thoughts moved over to the unknown name . \\n who was this grethen ? \\n father described him as a member of the courant , but there was no member named grethen . \\n i stood up from where i had been sitting and turned to place the book back on its shelf . \\n i had n't gathered much information about eris , but still i 've learned something . \\n eris was practicing a magic unknown to those in pearu . \\n what type of magic is the question ? \\n the diary mentioned a source . \\n was lilith the source i wondered to myself ? \\n i had no clue how old she was , but she was a witch . \\n she could have cast any type of spell to hide her true age from me . \\n my father had created the members of the courant to figure out , but there was no documentation on their findings . \\n maybe they have yet to discover the elements eris used . \\n the rest of the books on the shelf were nothing but maps and other diaries from when my father was young . \\n it was like he no longer trusted his journals to be safe . \\n i wonder if he knew i would someday discover this place . \\n or maybe , maybe someone else was prying and he did n't want them to know the most important stuff . \\n there was still a lot of room to search but not enough time . \\n i had been gone for a while now and the guards would soon come to check on me only to find that i was n't in the room . \\n the disappearance of the prince in a room with no windows and only one door was sure to create problems that will somehow get back to my father who would know where exactly i 'd disappeared to . \\n with that in mind , i climbed the stairs quickly , only stopping to glimpse the shelves . \\n i reached the sixth floor and came to a stop . \\n there were no shelves filled with books and statues on this floor . \\n this floor was empty except for the blue ball in the center of the room , hovering above the floor . \\n cautiously , i walked over to it , my eyes in a trance . \\n i came to a stop in front of it as i noticed that the blue shape was not of a ball , but a heart . \\n it was the crest of pearu with same golden snake wrapped around it . \\n unlike the crest of pearu , this heart actually glowed . \\n as i moved close to it , i could see white forms moving around inside of it , and if i listen closely , i could hear the heart beating . \\n curiosity suddenly got the best of me and before i knew it , my hand was reaching out to touch the heart . \\n the moment my hands latched onto the heart , the snake came to life and latched down onto my right hand . \\n i groaned in pain as traces of my blood dropped down on the heart disappearing within it . \\n with a sudden shock , i felt myself being pulled forward as if i was falling into the heart . \\n images raced past me as my father 's secret room disappeared leaving me on the streets of the mortal world . \\n i stared around confused as mortals walked past me . \\n it felt as if i had transported here as usual , but i knew i had n't . \\n a mortal bumped into me , but instead of knocking me to the side , they went through me . \\n it was like i was a ghost . \\n i tested out my theory by waving my hands in front of the mortals , but i remained unseen . \\n as i tried to get a grip on what was going on , i realized that everything was in black and white . \\n it was like i was in a picture show . \\n out the corner of my eye , i caught a flash of color . \\n i turned quickly just in time to see a woman in red across the street . \\n even from here i could tell that she was not a mortal , but a creature of the damned . \\n i made my way over to her hoping that she would n't detect me . \\n thankfully she did n't as she continued on her journey . \\n i followed her as she maneuvered past mortals , her walk set with determination . \\n she was going somewhere important and she would n't be moved . \\n she finally came to a stop at a hospital as she took a moment to peer up at it . \\n i read the hospital name . \\n phoebe putney memorial hospital . \\n the name was unknown to me and i had no idea exactly where it was located . \\n i did n't have time to find out either since the woman was moving again . \\n she entered the hospital and headed towards the set of elevators . \\n the elevator took us to the second floor , as it opened and we stepped out . \\n the woman walked past the nurses ' desk as she warned the creature that she should n't be up here . \\n she ignored her and moved on the down hall . \\n i could smell the scent of baby mortals and knew were on the delivery floor . \\n it was confirmed once the woman entered the nursery . \\n i moved to the side as i watched her close and lock the door and place a chair behind it . \\n it would n't hold for long and she seemed to know that . \\n as she moved over to study the babies , i found myself studying her . \\n she was a kampe . \\n they rarely ventured into the mortal world . \\n this whole thing was very strange to me . \\n it got even stranger when she stopped in front of a baby male and removed a silver box . \\n i watch her stare at the baby before unlatching the box . \\n the top fell open as ball of light glowed within it . \\n she stared at the baby as if she was listening for something . \\n i found myself listening too and then realize what she was hearing . \\n the baby 's heartbeat . \\n it was slowing down . \\n the baby 's heart beat finally came to an end as it soul drifted from its body . \\n i looked around for the reaper he was nowhere to be found which was odd . \\n he should have been here . \\n the kampe did n't seem to mind the absence of the reaper as she quickly placed the ball of light into the baby . \\n mortal guards stood at the door as the kampe began to disappear , taking me with her . \\n the blur of different lands gave me a headache as i realized she was teleporting . \\n however , she was doing too much teleporting . \\n it was as if she was trying to erase her trail . \\n we finally came to a stop in a desert as she stared up at the sky . \\n `` well was n't that impressive . '' \\n we both turned and felt the shock of seeing lilith there . \\n she stood in front of the kampe unaware of my presence . \\n the two of them exchange words and i could feel the unsettling feeling that something was about to happen . \\n i was proven right when lilith made the kampe shed her mortal skin and reveal her true self . \\n lilith like me , wanted to know why she was in the mortal world . \\n lilith did n't seem to like her reply as she grasped the kampe by the throat . \\n this would not go well for the kampe and she seemed to know that . \\n `` go ahead and kill me . \\n but take caution that the same fate awaits you much sooner than you think . \\n your end is near . \\n in time you will be nothing . '' \\n lilith screamed with rage as the same blue power my father described coming from eris , shot from her hand freezing the kampe into place . \\n lilith removed her sword as it slashed cleanly through the air , removing the kampe 's head , its eyes staring up at the night sky . \\n the kampe 's body fell over as lilith wiped her word off on its clothes . \\n she placed it back in its hilt as she stared forward . \\n for a moment i thought she was staring at me , but then i remembered she could n't see me . \\n opening her mouth , she said . \\n `` what are you up to samr ? '' \\n there was no reply and i knew she was n't expecting any . \\n lilith took one more glance before teleporting away from the scene of the kampe as i felt myself being tugged back . \\n i flew back and landed on my back with a groan . \\n opening my eyes , i saw that i was back in the hidden room at the palace . \\n standing up , i stared at the glowing heart . \\n shaken by what i 'd seen , i turned and made my way back down the stairs away from the heart . \\n eleven the temperature in pearu today held a slight breeze as i stood within groups of dragon lilies and golden pansies . \\n my eyes stared up at the purple tint of the sky . \\n guards had flanked me as soon as i left my father 's study making sure to keep me under a watchful eye . \\n when the servants noticed i was heading towards the gardens , they flew in a panic to get snacks and drinks ready . \\n i told them i would be fine , but they did not want to chance it . \\n now as i stood here with the smell of curd and fresh bread tempting me with the blow of the wind , i found myself wishing that i 'd not let my curiosity gotten the best of me . \\n the vision from the room was still fresh on my mind that with every blink , it replayed . \\n i glanced down at my moonstone ring . \\n the silver band gleamed as bright as the day it was given it to me . \\n the white moonstone churned reminding me of the glowing heart in the study . \\n i dropped my hand and shook my head . \\n all of this was confusing . \\n i 'd seen something from the past , but yet there was a strange feeling that made me believe that the vision had not been random . \\n the snake had taken my blood and in turned brought forth a vision of a kampe with lilith . \\n this could n't have been not too long ago . \\n the time appeared to be in the forties which would have put it right around the time eris disappeared from pearu and the gates to the damned were closed . \\n however , i could n't figure out why was this kampe in the mortal world , and why was she putting the ball of the light in mortal baby . \\n i squeezed my eyes , as a nagging thought in the back of my head came to me . \\n `` no . '' \\n i said shaking my head . \\n `` i wo n't believe it . '' \\n `` what wo n't you believe ? '' \\n i turned around to see kiowa standing there . \\n i turned back around . \\n `` what are you doing here ? '' \\n `` i 'd been looking for you . \\n the servants told me that you were resting in your father 's study , so i decided to leave you alone . '' \\n `` why were you looking for me ? '' \\n her feet shuffled in the grass behind me . \\n `` i wanted to apologize . \\n i 'd done to you what your father does all the time . \\n i 'd jumped on you without letting you explain . \\n i know you aristaeus . \\n you 're a smart and loyal creature . \\n you would n't have done what your father told me unless you had a good reason for it . \\n and even if you did n't , i still should have listened to you and what you were feeling . \\n you 're my son after all . '' \\n i closed my eyes at her mentioning the fact that i was her son . \\n the image of the mortal baby and the light came to me once more . \\n `` i just do n't understand aristaeus . \\n please help me to understand . \\n why were you with that god and why are you and dyos hiding something ? '' \\n `` did father ask you to question me ? '' \\n i asked opening my eyes . \\n kiowa made a hurt noise . \\n her hand touched my shoulder as i felt the tenseness that had been in me sense i came out here , leave my body . \\n `` do you really have to ask me that ? \\n i care about what 's going on with you not because the king may want to know , but because you are my son and i love you . '' \\n moving kiowa 's hand off of my shoulder , i turned to face her again . \\n ` then as your son , tell me the truth . '' \\n `` the truth ? \\n the truth about what ? '' \\n `` about my birth . '' \\n kiowa stared at me . \\n her eyes searched mine as if she was trying to figure out exactly what it is that i knew . \\n i decided to help her out a bit for my patience was running thin . \\n `` i know that the king is not my real father and that a member of the courant named grethen , was the one who brought me to you . '' \\n i decided to leave out the vision for now until i knew she would tell me the whole truth . \\n once kiowa told me the truth , my thoughts on the vision will be confirmed . \\n kiowa glanced at me for a second trying to decide on whether or not to tell me . \\n whatever she saw in my face gave her the answer as she turned to wave the guards away . \\n the guards glanced at her hesitantly , but with another sharp glance from the queen , they backed away taking the servants with them . \\n she then turned back to face me . \\n `` come . '' \\n i took her hand as she led me further away from the guards and deeper into the garden . \\n we came to a spot in the middle of the garden where she often liked to come and read . \\n she sat on bench as i sat down beside her . \\n `` aristaeus , you must know that with me telling you this , i am breaking the trust i have with the king . \\n if he finds out -- '' `` he wo n't . '' \\n `` how much do you know already ? '' \\n `` i know about grethen bringing me to you , and i know he never told father who my true parents were . '' \\n kiowa nodded as she took this in . \\n `` you are right . \\n i had been trying to have a child for a while . \\n nine times to be exact . \\n i could conceive but could never carry to full term . \\n the depression i faced for not being able to give birth and embarrassment i felt your father must have felt for having a barren wife , became too much for me . \\n i begged your father to unwed me , but he denied it every time . \\n one night , there was a pounding at the palace doors . \\n the fact that someone was up walking around pearu when the king was sleep was unheard of . \\n your father wanted whoever it was to be assassinated until he realized it was grethen . \\n at first , he thought that grethen was here to deliver news about eris , but then he saw the bundle in his arms . \\n i remember standing outside your father 's study wanting to glimpse whatever grethen had found . \\n they stayed in the study for twenty minutes before grethen left , his arms vacant of the bundle . \\n when your father exited , he gave me a smile and called me over . '' \\n kiowa paused and smiled . \\n `` as i peered in the blanket i found myself ready to cry at the sight of the baby in your father 's arms . \\n at that time , i experienced the feeling mortal mothers go through . \\n i remember staring down at you , your body covered in scales as every now and then your lizard tongue made an appearance . \\n i looked up at your father and he said , `` we finally have a child . '' \\n `` this grethen , you said he was a member of the courant . \\n what happened to him ? '' \\n `` though your father loved you , he still felt there was something off about you . \\n your father always had to know the answers to everything . \\n i think knowing the answers made him feel at ease . \\n so he went to grethen to try and get it out of him again on where he got you from . \\n grethen was tight lip as always , but this time your father would not let it slide . \\n something did n't seem to add up to your father , so he had grethen followed . \\n grethen seemed to realize that your father no longer trusted him anymore , so he disappeared . \\n it was like eris all over again . \\n there was no trace of him in any parts of pearu . '' \\n `` did he go to zeus about this issue ? '' \\n i asked even though i already knew the answer . \\n kiowa laughed . \\n `` no . \\n your father rarely to zeus about anything that had to deal with pearu . \\n he did n't trust the god and made it known to us all the time . \\n the only time he communicated with zeus was when zeus contacted him first . \\n your father would like to live as if zeus never existed . '' \\n i listened to what kiowa was saying and realized something . \\n though my father liked to claim himself different than eris , they both seemed to possess the hatred for zeus , and both wanted him erased from existence . \\n i wondered what would happen if my father ever got the chance to possess the skills eris possessed . \\n would he become like her , on a journey to destroy both gods and mankind . \\n it seemed like he was on the path already despite his claims . \\n `` so , he never found out about my birth ? '' \\n `` nope . \\n it is one answer ca n't figure out just yet . '' \\n i laughed humorously . \\n `` so that 's why he does n't deal with me and keeps me at arm 's length . \\n i 'm nothing more to him than a puzzle that he ca n't seem to figure out . '' \\n `` do not say such things aristaeus , your father loves you . \\n despite where you might have come from , he is still your father . '' \\n `` i know that kiowa . \\n however , that does not change the fact that he ca n't seem to be happy with what he has . \\n maybe it 's good that he has n't found out where i 've came from yet . \\n maybe its fate 's way of trying to show him how good he has it . '' \\n kiowa stared at me for a moment . \\n `` this is really bothering you , is n't it ? \\n you 've never seem to care about what your father thought until now . \\n what is it ? \\n have you found something else out ? \\n did that god tell you something ? '' \\n `` what makes you think she knows anything ? '' \\n `` because she 's a god and they see all . '' \\n i scoffed . \\n `` you would think . '' \\n `` so , you two have talked about this ? '' \\n kiowa asked carefully as if she was skating on thin ice . \\n `` about your birth . '' \\n i shook my head . \\n `` no . \\n but she does think there 's something different in me . \\n she 's not the only one though . \\n zeus and lilith have both noticed it . '' \\n `` do not worry about them . \\n there is nothing wrong with you . \\n they are just trying to find reason to cause problems . \\n especially this lilith , she 's probably using you to bait your father . '' \\n `` father seems to thinks so to which is why he has me currently under lock and key . '' \\n we were quiet for a moment , both trapped in our own thoughts . \\n `` aristaeus , i know i have said plenty of things about the gods . \\n i ca n't sit here and tell you that i did n't mean any of the things that i have said because it will be a lie . \\n like your father , i have only envisioned you of as how a king shall act . \\n communicating ... and having ... feelings for a god , a king should possess . \\n it 's blasphemy . \\n but as i sat there in my chambers , i did n't think as a queen would of a king , i thought as a mother of her son . \\n and as a mother , i could care less what species the creature you love is , as long as she makes you happy , than i am happy . '' \\n i turned to stare at kiowa as she smiled softly at me . \\n i could see in her eyes she was n't just saying that to get back in my good graces , but that she actually meant everything she was saying . \\n it did n't matter how i felt about astraea . \\n she would overlook it , for me , her son . \\n i reached over and pulled her into a hug as her arms circled me , gripping me tightly . \\n the truth was i had been debating over my own feelings for astraea . \\n they were new and foreign to me . \\n a part of me was still trying to pass it off as a spell , but i knew i was only lying to myself . \\n i liked her . \\n but was it enough to go against my own kind ? \\n my parents were right , in time i will become king . \\n if i am to rule the world of pearu , whatever feelings i would have for astraea would have to vanquish . \\n even as i thought that , i found myself thinking of ways to join both worlds of gods and demons . \\n kiowa and i decided to call it a day in the garden and headed back towards the palace . \\n the guards resumed their places flanking us as we entered the back doors of the palace . \\n she stopped in the hall near the kitchen and turned to me . \\n `` i 'll go and inform the servants to get dinner ready . \\n did you have a taste for anything particular tonight ? \\n i was thinking stew , but we always have stew huh ? '' \\n `` whatever you order is find . \\n i do not have much of an appetite . '' \\n `` you hardly touched the snacks the servants brought you , and i heard that you did n't eat the starfish you ordered . '' \\n `` i guess i just was n't as hungry as i thought i was . '' \\n `` you need to eat aristaeus . \\n i wo n't have you starving yourself over whatever is stressing you out . \\n i 'll order the servants to prepare some roasted hagfish and squid . \\n that should perk you right up . '' \\n `` fine . '' \\n kiowa stood on her tiptoes to kiss my cheek before hurrying off to the kitchen , the servants ' right behind her . \\n `` any word from the king ? '' \\n i asked one of the guards . \\n `` no your highness . \\n however , we do expect word from him soon . '' \\n i nodded . \\n `` let me know when you do and let me know when dyos arrive . '' \\n i left the company of the guards and headed up the stairs to my quarters . \\n i entered my room to see fresh clothes folded on the edge of my bed . \\n i had forgotten that i was still wearing the drenched alcohol clothing from earlier . \\n i guess my nose had become immune to the smell . \\n i remove my clothing and headed towards the bathroom . \\n i washed off in the shower , finding relief in the hot streams of water . \\n once i was finished , i dressed and for once left my hair down . \\n i walked over to the desk in my room and sat down . \\n on it were several stacks of folders i 'd yet to approve . \\n maybe this is another reason why my father seems to be angry all the time . \\n i am lacking in my duties as prince . \\n grabbing one of the folders , i skimmed through it taking in the proposal before signing off on it . \\n i did this over and over until all of the folders either had an approve sign from me or not . \\n leaning back in the chair , i closed my eyes as astraea 's face came to me . \\n that was how the servant found me when she entered my room . \\n `` excuse me your highness , dyos have entered the palace . '' \\n `` thank you . '' \\n the servant nodded and retreated as i stood up . \\n i grabbed the hair twister and placed my hair up before going to meet dyos . \\n dyos sat at the bottom of my steps surrounded by guards . \\n he stared at them in confusion probably due to the fact that he 's never had guards to follow him around . \\n welcome to my life . \\n `` dyos . '' \\n `` aristaeus ! '' \\n he said jumping up . \\n `` what 's going on ? \\n why am i being followed by your stalkers ? '' \\n `` that my friend , you must take up with the king . '' \\n `` do n't worry i will . '' \\n i chuckled and turned to the guards . \\n `` give us a moment . '' \\n `` but your highness , the king told us not to let him our sight . '' \\n `` the king is not here and i am in command and i say to give us a moment . '' \\n the guard bowed . \\n `` yes , your highness . '' \\n once the guards were gone , i turned to dyos who was smiling at me . \\n `` way to use your authority . '' \\n `` well i will be king someday . \\n it 's best they start listening to me now , for their sakes . '' \\n `` speaking of kings , why did the present king summon me ? '' \\n i stared at dyos trying to determine whether or not he remembered anything . \\n if he would have , he would n't have questioned why he was being brought here . \\n i take it to mean that he had yet to discover the scroll and produce his memories . \\n he was best left to think that we 'd really gotten drunk instead of meeting up . \\n at least until my father has read his memories . \\n `` you know my father . \\n he 's probably using you to keep me company or to give us lecture about our responsibility as the elite . '' \\n dyos made a face . \\n `` ugh . \\n i should have stayed home then . \\n i have a killer headache and my stomach is empty . \\n i ca n't bear to take one of your father 's lectures today . '' \\n `` no worries . \\n the king has left on business and the servants are preparing dinner . '' \\n dyos laughed . \\n `` ah , well i guess i am glad to keep you company . \\n what shall we do until dinner is served ? '' \\n `` fencing perhaps . '' \\n `` i did n't bring my weapon . '' \\n `` no worries , i have a supply . \\n besides , you wo n't have much use of it for long . '' \\n dyos cackled as we headed towards the small arena we had in the palace . \\n the servants brought me my demos as dyos was given a sword i use to practice with before this one . \\n `` try not to disfigure me too much young lord , i plan to have future dates . '' \\n `` i do not make any promises . \\n begin ! '' \\n the two of us ran towards each other , our swords clinking together . \\n the guards had given up their post and were now watching us with excitement . \\n dyos was a very good sword fighter . \\n his foot work was excellent and his delivery was improving . \\n the only thing was he lacked the strength that drilled me to win every time . \\n dyos was a happy going person and was hardly angry . \\n that is often while he loses . \\n with the type of weapons we possess , you often need a great strength to move them . \\n i learned when i was young , that anger seemed to be the best strength to use . \\n it was with that motion , that i became the best fighter in pearu , not only with weapons but with my body as well . \\n dyos moved his sword across the air as i bent back to avoid the near miss it would have made with my throat . \\n i bent back until i was forming a back flip . \\n my hands touched the ground as my feet connected with dyos chin . \\n dyos flew backwards as i landed on my feet . \\n the guards cheered as dyos pulled himself up from the ground . \\n `` hey , i said no face shots ! '' \\n `` are you upset dyos ? '' \\n i asked taunting him . \\n `` not even close . '' \\n he ran at me again swinging his sword wildly , as we both danced around . \\n he did manage to clip me on my arm and stomach a few times . \\n he had yet to get the point that i was trying to make him angry . \\n after all of these years , i was hoping to finally get at him , but still no such luck . \\n i grew tired of this cat and mouse game and decided to quickly end dyos . \\n his sword came at me and i dodged my head to the right . \\n my hand came up to clamp the arm holding the sword as i called fire to me , slowly heating his arm . \\n dyos yelped dropping his sword , as i flipped him over my body onto the ground . \\n his arm made as popping sound as he yelped out . \\n `` game over . '' \\n i said smiling down at him . \\n `` you dislocated my arm . '' \\n `` does that make you angry ? '' \\n dyos pushed up from the floor holding his arm . \\n `` no , but it does make me want to do something . '' \\n his eyes had a strange glint to it . \\n he was up to something . \\n grinning at me , he ran off screaming . \\n `` i 'm going to tell on you ! '' \\n my eyes widened as i stared at dyos retreating figure . \\n `` come now dyos , let 's not be childish . \\n there is no need to involve kiowa in this . '' \\n dyos reply was a laugh as he kept running . \\n before i knew it , i was chasing after him . \\n my boots slid across the floor as i ran after dyos . \\n there was a smile on my face as years from when i was young came to me . \\n dyos and i would always get into fights and i would always be him up and he would always get me back by running to tell kiowa . \\n i entered the kitchen to see dyos hovering next to kiowa who was petting him as if he was a baby . \\n at my presence she shot a glare in my direction . \\n `` aristaeus , why do you have to play so rough ? \\n i do not know how many times i have to get at you about this . \\n look at my poor dyos . \\n you will fix his arm at once ! '' \\n dyos grinned at me from across the room as i wanted to shake the grin off his face . \\n `` i am sorry mother , i will fix his arm . '' \\n dyos made his way over to me still smiling . \\n once he was close to me , i gave him a grin of my own before snapping his arm roughly back into place . \\n he yelped and fell to the ground . \\n `` aristaeus '' kiowa shouted . \\n `` you told me to fix his arm . '' \\n i said in an innocent tone . \\n kiowa shot me a lopsided smile as she made her way over to us . \\n `` enough foolishness you two , dinner is ready . '' \\n i helped dyos up as we made our way to the dining hall . \\n the two of us sat down across from each other as kiowa took her seat at the end of the table . \\n the servants entered as they placed trays of roasted hagfish and squid , bread , and stew on the table . \\n `` so , dyos have you found yourself a lady yet . '' \\n kiowa asked cutting a piece of her fish . \\n `` not yet your highness . \\n the lady creatures of pearu are quite beautiful , but there is no eye catching one as of yet . '' \\n `` well make sure she is up to par to take care of the castle . \\n when your father is gone you will be general . \\n you ca n't just have anybody as your wife . '' \\n `` that is true . \\n i am thinking of taking a harpy as a wife . '' \\n kiowa choked on her fish as i kicked dyos under the table . \\n `` he is joking . '' \\n i assured kiowa . \\n dyos grinned at kiowa as she laughed . \\n `` i forgot have funny you could be . '' \\n the doors to the dining hall opened as one of the guards entered . \\n `` your highness '' he said bowing to kiowa and i. `` the king has sent word that he will not be home tonight . \\n he will be staying in a palace on the outskirts of mayur . '' \\n `` will he be safe there with prince famar being dead ? '' \\n `` he assured us he will . \\n the other guards from the palace are there with him as well . \\n he shall be back in the morning . '' \\n `` very well . '' \\n kiowa said . \\n `` thank you . '' \\n the guard bowed again and disappeared back at the door leaving the room in an unsettling silence . \\n twelve after dinner was finished , the guards alerted us that the sky was beginning to darken signaling night in pearu . \\n kiowa retreated to her quarters after bidding dyos and i goodnight . \\n i was left alone with dyos who was sitting in a chair rubbing his stomach . \\n `` i do n't understand why you wish to leave this place so much aristaeus . \\n you have all the riches and best served meals than anyone i know in pearu . \\n i 'm thinking about asking the king if i can move in and become his adopted son . '' \\n i rolled my eyes at dyos . \\n `` i 'm sure that will go over smoothly with the king . \\n besides one adopted son is enough . '' \\n it slipped out before i could catch it . \\n dyos sat up and gave me a look of confusion . \\n `` what do you mean ? '' \\n `` nothing . '' \\n dyos continued to stare at me . \\n he did n't believe me . \\n clearing my throat i said , `` i 'm headed to bed . \\n you 're welcome to reside in my quarters or the guest quarters . '' \\n i got up before he could say anything else . \\n two guards flocked behind me as the rest stayed to accompany dyos . \\n once i arrived at my quarters i turned to nod at the guards . \\n i 'm sure they wanted to follow me upstairs and even guard me while i was sleep , but i was n't going to have that . \\n they could guard me with their life when i am king . \\n i shut the main door to my quarters and headed up the steps to my room . \\n entering my room , i saw that the servants had already pulled back my sheets and brought in fresh clothing and towels for the morning . \\n i stripped down to my shorts and tossed my clothes on the bench in front of my bed . \\n i undid my ponytail holder and tossed it on the stand beside the bed before climbing under the sheets . \\n leaning over , i blew out the candle encasing me in darkness . \\n folding my hands behind my head , i lay on the pillow and stared at the ceiling without really seeing it . \\n i could n't get rid of the thoughts of my mysterious birth . \\n i thought like my father , that grethen had brought me to the palace because he knew the trouble kiowa was having conceiving a child . \\n but his disappearance proved otherwise . \\n grethen knew my father was on to something , so he disappeared . \\n but what ? \\n grethen could n't have been a part of eris company could he ? \\n it could be possible . \\n he did disappear away from the lands of pearu like eris did . \\n however , the vision of the newborn and the kampe seemed to continue to break into my thoughts . \\n i shook my head to rid myself of such thoughts . \\n there was no way , is what i told myself . \\n i needed to find more answers before i acted on anything . \\n until then , that vision proved nothing . \\n closing my eyes , i relaxed my breathing as i fell into a slumber . \\n i do n't know how long it was when i closed my eyes that the usual blackness that accompanied me when i slept disappeared . \\n it was as if a curtain was being pulled back and i was staring through a window into another world . \\n my eyes like a camera zoomed around the room before i spotted her . \\n she stood in the middle of the room holding a cup , looking very much alive than when lilith removed her head . \\n shock went through me and i felt myself move . \\n the kampe turned in my direction and for a moment i thought she saw me , but she simply looked away . \\n she raised the cup to her mouth and sipped as she continued to stare out the window that was across the room . \\n suddenly , she placed the cup down on the table and walked over in my direction . \\n without knowing , i felt myself moving to the side out of her way . \\n there was a door behind me that i had n't noticed when i first entered the room . \\n the kampe headed towards the door , wrapping her fingers around the black handle and opening it . \\n bright sunlight shined through the door as i found myself squinting my eyes . \\n it was weird . \\n i was like i was actually here even though physically i was n't . \\n the sunlight was one that was similar to the one in the mortal world , but this world had a different feel to it . \\n it did n't feel like the mortal world . \\n the kampe stepped through the door , her hands clutching the brown dress she wore . \\n she followed a cobblestone pathway and every now and then she would stop to enjoy the breeze . \\n it was weird seeing a kampe or even a creature of the damned enjoying the beauty of any world except theirs . \\n a butterfly landed on her shoulder as she smiled and continued her way down the pathway as it led down a hill . \\n birds chirped above to the point it seemed like they were actually singing . \\n i wanted to turn around and assess the scenery some more , but my attention would n't let me . \\n it was stuck on the kampe . \\n her walk finally slowed as she came towards the end of the hill . \\n i could smell what seemed like the sea . \\n i was proven right at the sight of the beautiful blue water stretched out in front of me . \\n the kampe came to a quick stop that if i had actually been behind her , i would have collided with her back . \\n `` you 've been out here a while now . '' \\n i felt myself stare at the back of her head in confusion . \\n was she talking to me ? \\n did she actually know that i was here and she was just entertaining me , and then i thought about what she 'd just said . \\n she could n't have been talking to me . \\n `` i needed to think . '' \\n a voice came from in front of her . \\n the voice was so soft that i barely heard it . \\n the softness reminded me of astraea and i found myself trying to look around the kampe to see the person in front of her , but just like i could n't see the scenery , i could n't see who the voice belong to . \\n i was sure the person was a woman . \\n that much i was sure of . \\n `` you 're always thinking . \\n sometimes i ever wonder if you even sleep . '' \\n the woman laughed at the kampe 's comment . \\n `` are you worried about whether or not you can still trust me ? '' \\n `` i trust you kithara . '' \\n the woman answered . \\n so the kampe 's name was kithara . \\n the name was n't familiar to me , but that did n't mean i could n't search around to find out any more information on her . \\n someone in pearu was bound to know of the kampe . \\n `` i 'm just worried that i 'm sending you on a fool 's errand . '' \\n `` it 's not a fool 's errand . \\n what you 're doing is going to be for the greater good . \\n someone has to stop eris before she destroys everything . '' \\n eris ? \\n they were talking about eris ? \\n i tried once again to peer around at the woman but it seemed like an imaginary force was pushing me back behind kithara . \\n something did n't want me to see the woman 's face . \\n `` the greater good huh . \\n i 'm glad you see it like that . \\n i hope the gods will as well . '' \\n kithara scoffed . \\n `` those gods know nothing . \\n they 've turned a blind eye to the happenings in pearu a long time ago . \\n if they would have paid as much attention to the world of pearu as they do the mortal world they would have seen what eris was planning and could have stopped her . '' \\n `` the gods have a lot on their plate kithara . \\n they have their duties . '' \\n `` and yet , they have n't found eris . \\n how is it she is able to disappear from their sight ? '' \\n `` how is it that i am able to disappear from their sight ? '' \\n the woman replied . \\n `` eris might be a cruel creature , but she is still a clever one . \\n she has an army of supporters . \\n we must not underestimate her . '' \\n there was quiet between them as they both stared out at the sea . \\n a couple of gulls flew by as kithara raised her hand as if to wave to them . \\n the woman in front of her seemed to laugh . \\n `` what so funny ? '' \\n kithara asked . \\n `` it 's cute how childlike you seem at times . \\n every time you see a seagull you wave , every time you feel breeze of wind you stop to enjoy it . \\n it 's like you 're seeing everything again for the first time . '' \\n `` i ca n't help it . '' \\n kithara said leaning her head back . \\n i could see a smile around her face . \\n `` i love it here . \\n it 's so beautiful , so peaceful . \\n not that pearu is n't beautiful too . \\n it 's quite gorgeous actually . \\n it 's just this place ... this place put at my ease . \\n i 'm glad i 'm here . '' \\n `` and i 'm glad you 're here as well . \\n you can stay as long as you wish . '' \\n kithara dropped her head from the sky and stared at the woman in front of her . \\n her feet moved nervously across the grass . \\n `` i never thanked you for saving my life . \\n if you had n't been there when you had ... . \\n i do n't know what would have happen to me . '' \\n `` you do n't have to thank me for that . '' \\n `` but i do . \\n you were someone we were often told to hate . \\n you were the enemy , but yet you saved me when no one from my world could care less what happened to me . \\n my own parents turned their backs on me when it came to what the queen wanted . \\n they did n't even fight for me . '' \\n `` i 'm sure they had their reasons . '' \\n the woman softly . \\n the tone in her voice however stated otherwise . \\n she like kithara knew the truth about the betrayal of her parents . \\n i found myself sympathizing with kithara . \\n it was n't exactly unknown in the world of pearu where parents often betrayed their children for the throne . \\n children in pearu did n't last long with their families before they ended up venturing out on their own . \\n sometimes it was their decision and sometimes it was n't . \\n `` i know you 're just trying to comfort me . \\n it 's okay . \\n i 've overcame their harshness . \\n thanks to you , i still have a chance to become someone decent , someone worthy . \\n you 've gave me more than anyone has ever done for me in my entire life , and in return i shall repay you with my allegiance . '' \\n `` i 've told you that you do not have to repay me for saving your life kithara . \\n so if that 's why you feel you must do this for me , you can forget it . \\n i 'm not going to force you to do this for me . \\n i 'm also not going to kick you out if you do not this . \\n surely , you do not think of me as such a cold hearted creature . '' \\n the woman said almost sadly . \\n `` of course not ! \\n i could never think of you like that . \\n i just want you to know that i will never betray you . \\n i will do this for you because i want to and i believe in your cause . \\n i just wanted to thank you that is all . '' \\n `` you are welcome and thank you for believing in my cause . '' \\n `` many will believe as well . \\n just give it time . \\n once this is done , many will come to believe you like me and all the others do . \\n this will work . '' \\n `` do you remember what you are to do ? '' \\n `` yes . '' \\n kithara said nodding . \\n `` i am to return back to pearu and wait two days after zeus issue the sentence for zobyverth . \\n in that time i will have stolen the blood from the queen and delivered the message to your allies in pearu . \\n once you have broken the gate , i am to teleport to the atlantic sea in the mortal world where i will find the lost world of atlantis . \\n once there i am to find the box and the set of instructions you have left for me . '' \\n `` correct . \\n you have only a limited window . \\n once the gods notice the gate has been broken , they will flock down to find exactly how it was broken and who it was that escaped . \\n they will be on you in a matter of minutes so i will try to the stall the best way i can . \\n teleport to different places so they can not pinpoint your exact location . \\n you may end up getting caught . '' \\n `` do n't worry . \\n i am aware of the repercussions and i am ready to take them . \\n i will keep my lips sealed about everything i know . \\n the gods wo n't know a thing . '' \\n `` do not forget the gods can read your mind . \\n they can see everything you ever done in your entire life . \\n you wo n't be able to keep secrets from them . '' \\n the woman said . \\n `` well how i am supposed to keep them from learning about this or even you . \\n they 'll figure out everything before our plan can work . \\n they 'll end up killing us all . '' \\n `` let 's hope that it does not to come to that . '' \\n `` are you sure your guy will be there to finish the task ? \\n i mean do you trust him . '' \\n `` yes , i trust him . \\n he has proven himself to me well in the past . \\n i do not doubt his loyalty just like i do not doubt yours . '' \\n the two of them were silent again . \\n somewhere nearby something howled as kithara shivered . \\n `` you should get ready to leave . \\n the time is near . \\n you have to arrive in pearu before the assassination of the mortal adolf hitler . '' \\n `` are you sure that this is going to happen ? '' \\n kithara asked . \\n `` are you sure the gods are going to step in ? \\n they usually do n't involve themselves with mortal affairs . '' \\n `` they will this time . \\n they have orders coming from someone higher above . '' \\n `` the creator . \\n so he 's real . '' \\n the woman laughed . \\n `` your pearu side is showing . \\n i guess you have eris to thank for the lies you have been fed about the creator . \\n he is real . \\n just as you and are breathing . '' \\n `` have you ever seen him ? '' \\n `` if i had , do you think he would let me tell you that ? '' \\n the woman laughed again . \\n `` for you to not like mortals , you are you surely thinking like the . '' \\n `` what do you mean ? '' \\n `` you seem think as the mortals that god is a he . \\n why is that ? '' \\n `` i do n't know . \\n i guess i am thinking like a mortal . '' \\n kithara glanced off to the side her hair blowing in the wind . \\n turning back to the woman she said , `` i should get going . '' \\n kithara turned away from the woman and i found myself turning too . \\n i tried to divert my attention to the woman but failed again . \\n i felt like i was stretching my neck back . \\n i would see this woman 's face , not today . \\n `` kithara '' the woman suddenly called . \\n kithara paused and turned to stare back at the woman . \\n at the moment i could slightly see her . \\n if i was physically here , i would have fallen over in shock . \\n it was like i was mortal who 'd looked upon an angel . \\n the woman stood near the edge of the water dressed in a white gown that seemed to blow with ever breeze of the wind . \\n her hair was a deep black as it came down to the end of her elbows . \\n strands of it blew in the wind as the sun shined brightly behind her , blurring her face out . \\n it was the only part of her i could n't see . \\n the image standing in front of the sea with the bright shape of the sun behind her was something out of painting . \\n if only , i could see her face . \\n `` yes . '' \\n the woman stared at kithara for a long in time and in that second i understood . \\n she knew kithara would not come back . \\n she would die out there by the hands of lilith . \\n she knew that which was why she was trying to keep the image of her in her head . \\n `` i love you . '' \\n kithara eyes blinked and i could see tears form in her eyes . \\n she cared deeply for this woman as if she was her mother . \\n it was similar to the feeling i had for kiowa . \\n `` i love you too . '' \\n with that kithara turned and walked away , the woman fading away in the distance . \\n the vision i was seeing began to disappear as the faint sound of someone screaming came to me . \\n my eyes opened as i sat up quickly in the bed . \\n tossing the sheets to the side , i climbed out the bed and hurried over the window . \\n staring down out the window , i stared in horror as the guards were engaged in hand to hand combat with other creatures of pearu , and in the midst of them was lilith . \\n sensing my presence , she stared up at me a hint of a smile on her face . \\n more screams sounded in the palace as i finally realize what was happening . \\n the palace was under attack . \\n thirteen another screamed sounded and it was enough to snap me out of my daze and into action . \\n i threw on my clothes as fast as i could and grabbed my demos and my jugest . \\n i rushed down the stairs in my quarters as the sound of the battle got closer . \\n kicking open the door to my quarters , a servant ran passed me in the hall with a lamia chasing her . \\n it was gilda . \\n i unsheathed my demos and sent its blade into the tail of the lamia cutting it cleaned off . \\n the lamia fell to the ground screaming as it tried to hurry and reproduce its tail . \\n i did n't give it any chance of reproducing as i sent my blade across its neck removing its head . \\n gilda turned to me and cried . \\n `` thank you , young lord . '' \\n `` where is the queen ? '' \\n `` i do not know . \\n i think still in her quarters i 'm not sure . '' \\n a slight wave of fear went through me as i thought about kiowa being all alone in her quarters without anyone to defend her . \\n dyos i did not worry too much about because i knew he could handle himself in combat . \\n kiowa could n't . \\n `` find her and get her out of the palace . \\n i will find you , do you understand . \\n this is an order ! '' \\n she nodded . \\n `` right away your highness . '' \\n gilda ran off towards kiowa 's quarters as i turned back to jump in the fight . \\n if i wanted to make it to kiowa , i would first have to clear the way . \\n the rogue seemed to have doubled since the last time i seen her which meant her influence back in pearu was working . \\n the citizens must have learned of her return and decided they would not want to be on the opposite end of her wrath . \\n i turned my attention to a couple more lamia that had entered and were heading in my direction . \\n i sent my jugest over my shoulder as the rope circled around one trapping it . \\n the hand holding my demos went flying towards the other lamia , the blade removing its head in one swipe . \\n while the other lamia was trapped in my jugest , i sent fire through the rope torturing it before silencing the lamia forever . \\n yanking my jugest back to me , it wrapped around my shoulder as i turned to face three creatures entering the hall . \\n i found myself distracted at the sight of the hellhounds standing in our hallway . \\n they were creatures that were a myth in our land that parents told their children to keep them from angering the king . \\n they were creatures i never knew to exist . \\n but like every creature , i knew these could be killed as well . \\n the hell hounds seemed to make some kind of communication with each other as they formed a battle sequence around me . \\n the one in the middle leaped at me disappearing into thin air . \\n i stared around in confusion when all of a sudden i felt the ring on my hand heat up . \\n my right hand lifted in the air rising higher and higher . \\n a thought came to me as i tossed my demos to my right hand gripping the hilt and sending the blade through the air . \\n the hell hound reappeared just in time as the blade connected with its neck sending the head towards the floor as its body landed next to it . \\n the other hell hounds growled with rage at their fallen leader as they lunged towards me pulling the same disappearing . \\n the ring burned again as my hand lifted off towards the right . \\n my blade went towards the right killing , the second hell hound and then in the direction to the left where the ring was turning me . \\n the last hell hound fell to the ground at my feet blood splashing on my boots . \\n i stared down at the white moonstone ring . \\n the ring had never showed any source power until now . \\n it protected me by showing me where the hell hounds were . \\n i found myself thankful for a gift from my mother . \\n without it those hell hounds would have killed me . \\n a screaming minotaur waving a battle axe seemed to bring me back to the fight . \\n the blade of the axe came towards me as i threw my demos in front of me blocking it . \\n the minotaur possessed an insane strength as i struggled not to let the axe cut me . \\n the minotaur seemed to know that he had the upper hand as he smirked down at me , snot and goo coating around his nose . \\n the smirk on his face suddenly change to one of shock as his whole body weight fell down on me . \\n i let out a yelp as we both tumbled to the ground . \\n i felt the sharp end of the axe slice into my chest as the weight of the minotaur pushed down on me . \\n the weight suddenly lessened , as i felt the minotaur being pulled off of me . \\n the minotaur 's body fell off to the side as a bloody dyos came into view . \\n `` aristaeus ! '' \\n he shouted . \\n he knelt down beside me and grabbed the hilt of the axe and tugged it from my chest . \\n dyos was a warrior like me and knew that when it came to a weapon being lodged into your body , the best thing to do is remove it , than sitting around preparing someone that you are going to remove it . \\n blood gushed from the wound as i found myself groaning in pain . \\n `` the cut is n't that bad . \\n can you stand ? '' \\n `` yeah . '' \\n i pushed up from the floor to stand . \\n dyos was right . \\n the cut was n't that bad and the pain was n't too unbearable . \\n i 've been cut before . \\n i could handle it . \\n `` what is happening ? \\n i awoke to screams and the next thing you know i got creatures trying to kill me . '' \\n `` lilith is here . '' \\n i said . \\n `` i need you to find kiowa and get her out of here . \\n i sent a servant for her but i do n't know if she reached her in time . \\n please friend , i am begging you . '' \\n `` you do n't even need to say anymore . \\n i 'll find her and keep her safe . '' \\n dyos patted my shoulder and ran off in the direction of kiowa 's quarters . \\n i just hoped he got her before lilith did . \\n i moved further into the battle slaying any and every creature that got in my way . \\n throughout it all i received a number of slashes on my body . \\n the wounds were n't that deep , but they were enough to make me faint . \\n i had to force myself to keep going . \\n kiowa depended on me . \\n my citizens depended on me . \\n as i made my way through the battle i began to notice that some of my father 's guards had joined lilith . \\n i 'm sure they had a reason for it seeing how their friends ' bodies lied around us everywhere . \\n however , i had would not sympathize . \\n they signed their loyalties with eris so they signed their deaths . \\n as my sword slashed through those of my father 's guards , some of their faces had a look of remorse . \\n they 'd realize too late what they had done . \\n the last body in the hallway dropped to the ground as i stood over it . \\n glancing around me i saw the bodies of the rogues , the guards , and the innocent servants of the palace . \\n i did n't have time to stand and grieve over them . \\n i had yet to see lilith since i arrived downstairs . \\n she was somewhere in this palace but where . \\n i gave another glance around before running in the direction of kiowa 's quarters . \\n bodies lined the hallway as i ran pass them . \\n there were clunks of debris on the ground coating my boots in gray dust . \\n ahead of me i could hear the sound of weapons clashing and prayed that kiowa was somewhere safe . \\n rounding the corner , i bent in the nick of time as an axe flew towards my head . \\n i threw my jugest at the creature in front of me , the rope circled its neck and i pulled . \\n i yanked the jugest back to me and stared at the scene . \\n gilda lay slain on the ground as dyos fought lilith . \\n dyos sent his sword at lilith who dodged it smoothly . \\n her foot connected to his chest sending him flying into wall behind him . \\n his head knocked against the stone wall as he fell over crumbling to the floor unmoving . \\n kiowa screamed in rage and pulled a weapon off a nearby guard and started to attack lilith . \\n i took a step about to race towards lilith when i felt myself being lifted . \\n a giant held me in his arms as he lifted me up in the air . \\n his hands clutched around my thighs that were tiny compared to his fists . \\n with a roar of pleasure , he sent me flying across the room . \\n i tried to stretch my limbs out so i would land safely , but the force behind the giant 's throw was too powerful and my head collided into the wall like dyos did . \\n i landed on the ground as blood rushed into my mouth coating my teeth . \\n my head was pounding as i slowly pushed myself up . \\n the blood in my mouth seemed to rile the pearu side of me as i felt my true self pushing forward . \\n i turned to face the giant as the heat that accompanied a hell demon , wrapped around me encasing me , trapping me . \\n two guards raced to the giant side and started to poke at its legs . \\n the giant glanced down at the two guards and laughed . \\n with a wave of his hand , he sent the guards flying in the opposite direction . \\n taking use of his slight distraction , i raced forward with demon speed . \\n i pushed off the balls of my feet thrusting myself into the air . \\n i landed on the giant 's shoulder and sent my blade down into the side of his neck . \\n the giant hollered in pain as his hands reached up to swat at me . \\n i dodged his hands and sent the blade again into his neck . \\n unlike the lamia and minotaur , a giant was difficult to kill . \\n removing their head took a lot of work , but it could be done . \\n the rage of true form seemed to rile with blood lust every time i stuck the giant . \\n the blood loss was beginning to take its toll as the giant stumbled around . \\n calling forth all the anger and blood lust in me , i raised the sword high and sent it down at the giant 's neck . \\n the head fell cleanly off and landed loudly against the floor . \\n a few of the rogue stopped their fighting and stared over at the dead giant . \\n they stared at me with a slight hint of fear . \\n i stood on the giant 's body as it fell to the floor not once falling over . \\n i turned to stare at lilith who seemed shaken at the fact i 'd taken out one of her giant 's as well . \\n kiowa tried to take advantage of lilith 's distraction . \\n she sent the axe at lilith aiming for her head . \\n lilith however snapped back just in time . \\n she blocked the axe knocking it from kiowa 's hand . \\n she waved her finger at kiowa . \\n too quick before my eyes , lilith slashed kiowa across her stomach . \\n i stared in horror as pain radiated through my body . \\n it felt as if i 'd been struck myself . \\n kiowa fell to the ground clutching her stomach as her eyes closed . \\n `` no !!! '' \\n i yelled out . \\n i leaped off the giant 's body and ran towards lilith . \\n i was seeing red now . \\n i wanted to kill lilith . \\n i was going to kill lilith . \\n lilith turned to face me with a smirk on her cruel lips . \\n i would wipe that smirk off . \\n i leaped up off the ground with my sword and swung it at lilith . \\n lilith blocked the blade from my demos as her hands clutched the blade . \\n the two of us stared at each other as i tried to force my sword from her hands . \\n `` what 's the matter aristaeus ? \\n upset that i hurt your mommy ? '' \\n i did n't bother to reply to her . \\n my attention was on getting my demos out of her hands so i could kill her and get kiowa some help . \\n lilith seemed oblivious or better yet unfazed to any of this . \\n `` but she 's not really your mother is she ? \\n you 're no one 's child . \\n not hers and definitely not the king 's . '' \\n `` shut up ! '' \\n i growled . \\n `` who exactly are you aristaeus ? \\n better yet , what are you ? '' \\n `` your reaper ! '' \\n i shouted finally getting my blade out her hand . \\n gripping the hilt of my demos tightly in my hand , i slashed at lilith . \\n she jumped back but not quick enough . \\n the blade cut through her gown as blood showed through the cut . \\n she stared at me in anger and it was now my turn to smirk . \\n that would n't be the only cut she would be receiving tonight . \\n i brought my demos up again ready to strike her down , but i did n't get the chance . \\n lilith reached forward as her hand rested on my chest . \\n a coldness shot through my body as my demos dropped to the ground . \\n it felt as if i 'd been dipped into ice as the coldness spread through my body freezing me into place . \\n my eyes stared at her as she sent her fist into my chest . \\n i flew back from the force of her punch . \\n my body collided against some glass shelves as i slumped to the floor . \\n i lay paralyzed to the ground with the pain of slight stinging over my body . \\n lilith took a step towards me to finish me off when a loud thunder sounded and a bright light filled the room . \\n everyone turned their attention towards the bright light . \\n my eyes were the only thing that i could move as i turned to stare in the same direction . \\n the light was a blinding one and i wanted to shield my eyes but i could n't move . \\n the light disappeared leaving behind a kneeling figure . \\n the figure suddenly stood as everyone in the room suddenly backed up . \\n the head of the figure turned in my direction as i stared in surprise . \\n astraea stood in the center of room dressed in the armor the gods had worn when i first saw them . \\n her eyes stared into mine not caring that she was in a room full of creatures that wanted her dead . \\n i wanted to ask her what was she doing here , but i already knew the answer . \\n she was here for me . \\n i felt a stirring in my chest as emotions clouded me . \\n she was being stupid again . \\n she 'd risked herself by coming here . \\n but even as i thought that , another thought came to me . \\n i was glad to see her . \\n i missed her . \\n the creatures of pearu stared at the god in awe . \\n this was their first time ever seeing a god , especially one in the world of pearu . \\n even lilith wore a shock look on her face . \\n i 'm guessing she had not counted in the gods coming to the world of pearu . \\n astraea 's sudden surprise had caught her off guard . \\n the creatures of pearu seemed to get over their shock quicker than i thought . \\n the enemy was no longer each other . \\n both the rogue and the king 's guards raced towards astraea ready to strike her down . \\n astraea turns back and stared at the creatures running at her . \\n she barely blinked as she raised her hand knocking the creatures off to the side . \\n she then turned to face lilith who had taken the time to compose herself again . \\n `` i should have known you would come for him astraea . '' \\n lilith said with amusement . \\n `` i just did n't think you would come all the way to pearu for him . '' \\n `` this war of innocent blood ends here . '' \\n `` how does it feel to betray your father astraea ? \\n you 've known him you entire life and yet you turn your back on him for someone you 've just met not even a few weeks ago . '' \\n astraea ignored eris . \\n `` lilith , creature of baba yaga , you are ordered to return with me to seek punishment for your actions in both the world of pearu . '' \\n `` punishment you say . \\n will you be receiving punishment as well for your disobedience against the great zeus ? \\n i 'm sure once you tell him that you love aristaeus , he will take pity on you . \\n i mean surely your father must understand your feelings . '' \\n `` this is your last warning . '' \\n astraea said . \\n i could tell what she was saying was getting to her . \\n i tried to force my limbs to move , but they would n't . \\n whatever lilith had done to me was keeping me frozen . \\n i had to get out of this . \\n `` why is it that you have fallen for aristaeus ? \\n i overheard you say you found him to be interesting . \\n i guess i can agree with that , because i too find him to be quite interesting . '' \\n lilith said glancing over at me . \\n she turned her attention back to astraea . \\n `` but i did not notice how interesting he was until i finally got a big whiff of him , yet you seemed to know way before the two of you met . \\n why is that ? \\n is it because you felt sorry for the king to be , or is it you know what really lies in his blood , and that is not all demon blood . '' \\n astraea stared across the room at lilith . \\n her head dropped at those words as she darted a glance over at me . \\n was what lilith saying true ? \\n did astraea know something about me ? \\n lilith laughed seeing the same thing i did in astraea 's face . \\n `` you know do n't you ! \\n tell me ! '' \\n she gave a wave of her hand at astraea . \\n astraea 's attention turned from me as she stared at eris . \\n a slight tremor of fear went through me at what she could be doing to astraea . \\n `` where did you get that ? '' \\n astraea asked suddenly her voice fierce . \\n lilith hand dropped as she stared at astraea confused . \\n it did n't work . \\n whatever she 'd been trying to do to astraea did n't work . \\n astraea took a step towards lilith and removed her sword . \\n `` i asked you where you got that power ! '' \\n she did n't reply to astraea . \\n with a growl of rage and somewhat fear she shot her hand forward as blue lightning shot out . \\n astraea dodged the light her eyes confused on what she was seeing . \\n lilith ran at her and threw her fists at her knocking her sword out her hand . \\n astraea got over her confusion as she blocked lilith 's fists . \\n she swatted her hands to the side as she punched her in the face . \\n the sound was similar to that of a rock dropping and it vibrated around the whole room . \\n lilith flew back into a painting that had been hanging on the wall . \\n lilith and the painting fell to the ground with dust all around it . \\n once again i tried to force my limbs to move . \\n i thought with lilith down , her hold on me would drop . \\n yet she was still holding on strong . \\n astraea runs over to me and gripped my arm . \\n `` are you okay ? '' \\n `` no . \\n she 's ... got me ... paralyzed . '' \\n i barely managed to get the words out . \\n i felt suffocated as if i could n't breathe . \\n astraea gripped my arm tighter and closed her eyes . \\n she mumbled something in a language i could n't understand . \\n it sounded like a incantation . \\n she held my arm a minute longer before opening her eyes . \\n confusion was on her face again as she stared down at me . \\n `` i do n't understand . \\n it should have worked . \\n you should be able to move now . '' \\n the confusion and worry in her eyes made me want to try to move again despite the pain i was feeling . \\n i tried with all the strength i had to try and break the spell lilith had me under but it was still no use . \\n i sighed and looked up at astraea . \\n `` i. . . \\n ca n't . \\n just ... get ... out of here . '' \\n `` i 'm not leaving you behind . '' \\n astraea tried once more to break the spell focusing all her attention on me . \\n my eyes had been staring at her when a figure behind her began to stand . \\n i moved my eyes past astraea to see lilith standing up . \\n her body seemed to be unharmed . \\n even the scratch i had put on her earlier was gone . \\n she turned to face us , a deep scowl set on her face . \\n i opened my mouth to warn astraea but with a twist of her hand , lilith stopped me . \\n like a statue , i was frozen into place as i watched her creep up on astraea who was kneeling in front of me unaware . \\n i tried to force any kind of sound to alert her , but nothing would come out . \\n i finally remembered that she could feel when i needed her . \\n closing my eyes , i mentally shouted at her `` astraea behind you ! '' \\n our eyes opened at the same time as we stared at each other . \\n astraea turned in time to dodge the blue light lilith had shot at her . \\n the light crashed into the stone behind me , knocking debris down on my head . \\n `` i see why your father never allows you out . \\n you 're a pain . '' \\n she seethed . \\n `` no worries . \\n i will do this one favor to zeus by ridding him of the responsibility of having a daughter like you . '' \\n `` the only one who 's disappearing will be you . \\n elysian stone ! '' \\n a gold light shot from astraea 's outstretched hands . \\n the light shot through the air towards lilith who did n't bother to move . \\n the light was heading for her yet she would n't move . \\n as the light finally neared her , lilith outstretched her hands , catching the light in them . \\n astraea and i stared at lilith in shock as the ball of light hovered in her hands . \\n she stared down at the ball as her eyes slowly drifted back up to astraea , a smile hinting at her lips . \\n suddenly the gold ball of light began to change to a black color . \\n astraea backed up as the once gold light was completely taken over by the black light . \\n `` silly god . '' \\n lilith pushed out her hands as the black ball left her hands . \\n astraea raised her hands to block the ball but it was no use . \\n the ball collided with astraea 's chest as the light resembled shock waves . \\n astraea 's mouth opened with a scream as her body lifted off the floor . \\n the scream was one filled with abysmal pain as the black light moved all over her body . \\n the pain finally became too much for her as her body dropped to the ground , the black light still moving on her body . \\n i stared across the room at astraea 's limp form , her eyes close and a touch of gold running out the corner of her mouth . \\n she was n't moving . \\n she 's not moving . \\n i looked over at lilith who was staring at her , the gleam of pleasure in her eye for taking out a god . \\n closing my eyes , i kept hearing astraea 's scream in my head , i kept seeing her limp form before my eyes . \\n with a growl of rage , i felt my body tremble as i forced myself to move . \\n my limbs shook as i slowly lifted from the floor . \\n lilith turned to face me a look of disbelief on her face . \\n she waved her hand giving a twist -- a wave of pain hit me dropping me a little . \\n however , it was not enough to keep me down . \\n once again i pushed myself up from the ground , not once taking my eyes off of her . \\n i finally had enough strength to push to my feet . \\n i felt a new wave of power shoot through me as the moonlight ring on my hand once more lit up . \\n the power was much stronger than when i felt it before . \\n it was n't painful , it was actually peaceful . \\n it felt as if it had been a part of me all along . \\n all of a sudden i did n't feel just like a hell demon , but something much more powerful . \\n soft whispers of a woman 's voice vibrated through my head . \\n at first i could not understand them because the voice was moving too fast . \\n i could see the voice line in my head as a white string that shook fiercely . \\n with an invisible hand , i reached into my mind and smoothed out the line until was straight and moved softly . \\n i could hear the voice now . \\n it was a woman 's voice . \\n it was her voice . \\n the woman i 'd dreamed about . \\n the woman who 'd been with kithara . \\n `` aristaeus , it is time . \\n reveal yourself . '' \\n closing my eyes , i felt a new wave of skin wash over me as the wounds i 'd endured during battle , reattach itself until my skin was completely new . \\n my skin felt tougher but yet softer . \\n somewhere i could feel my hell demon side behind the thick layer . \\n i was still me . \\n but now , now i was something more powerful . \\n my eyes opened as i stared across the room at lilith who 'd begun to back up . \\n `` impossible . '' \\n she breathed out . \\n `` impossible ! '' \\n she said this time with much more force . \\n she screamed with rage as she ran at me withdrawing a small scythe . \\n i stood in front of her and waited patiently . \\n once she was three feet in front of me , i shot my hand out to the side and said , `` demos ! '' \\n my demos flew from across the room to my hand . \\n lilith 's scythe slashed at my head as i lifted my demos to block it . \\n our weapons held against each other as we stared into each other 's eyes . \\n for the first time since meeting lilith , i sensed fear . \\n she was scared of me now . \\n i had changed into something she was n't prepared for , something she had n't expected . \\n her eyes darted nervously back and forth as she tried to put more force behind that of her scythe . \\n had i still been a hell demon , she probably would have succeeded in knocking me down on the floor . \\n but now , i barely moved from her power . \\n the creatures that had been unconscious slowly came to . \\n they stood and stared over at lilith and me . \\n some of them inch forward to come to her aide , but stopped once she raised her hand . \\n `` no ! \\n i can handle him ! '' \\n i smirked at that which seemed to anger her even more . \\n more power raided through her body into her weapon as she continued to try and push me back . \\n out the corner of my eye i watch dyos come to . \\n he stared over at us and leaped up to his feet ready to jump in if needed . \\n i could see his eyes roaming over me every now and then as if he was seeing me for the first time . \\n in a way , he was . \\n i decided to end this game with lilith . \\n calling forth the power from the ring , a white light shined from eyes . \\n the light was bright enough to distract lilith as she dropped her power level and reached her hand up to block the light . \\n everyone in the room raised their hand to block the light coming from my eyes as it filled up the room . \\n drawing back my fist , i sent it forward , colliding with her . \\n lilith flew back colliding with her minions as they all tumbled to the ground . \\n thunder roared from above as a different color of light entered the room . \\n the golden light shined from in front of me as it slowly disappear revealing zeus , poseidon , and athena . \\n the three gods stood from their kneeling position as they withdrew their weapons . \\n athena 's attention turned to astraea who lay unconscious on the floor . \\n she ran to her side and held her sister , calling her name . \\n it was strange , even though she was speaking in another language , i understood it . \\n zeus stared over at his daughter as a wave of emotions flew past his face quicker than his changing eyes . \\n his eyes moved from astraea and settled on me . \\n inside his head , i could hear him say `` impossible . '' \\n poseidon and athena turned hearing the same thought as i did . \\n they stared at their king before following his eyes over to me . \\n the shock that radiated through them seemed to cloud my head . \\n `` this ca n't be . '' \\n `` zeus is this possible '' `` we have to kill him ! \\n it is our duty ! '' \\n i shifted my stance as i stood on guard against the other gods . \\n if it was a battle they wanted , than it 's a battle they get . \\n astraea moving in the corner took our attention off of each other as we turned to her . \\n her eyes opened and i felt a tension that i had n't noticed , leave me . \\n she stood to her feet with the help of her sister athena . \\n `` are you okay sister ? '' \\n athena spoke into her mind . \\n as if remembering that i was there , she flicked her eyes over at me in anger . \\n i was protruding on their thoughts and she did n't like it . \\n `` i am fine , athena . '' \\n astraea 's eyes roamed the room searching for someone before landing on me . \\n her eyes seemed to resemble mine as her thoughts broadcasted , `` thank you , he is okay . '' \\n `` i 'm okay . '' \\n i answered back to her . \\n astraea blinked and finally got a good look at me . \\n unlike everyone else , she did n't seem to be shock to see that i 'd changed . \\n it was as if something had just been confirmed for her . \\n the boom sound of someone teleporting brought us back to the fact that there was another enemy in the room . \\n we turned where lilith had been standing to see that she was gone . \\n she 'd taken advantage of our slight distraction and used it to escape . \\n she 'd left her minions behind as they stared at the spot she 'd been standing . \\n their eyes turned to the gods in fear . \\n some of them began to teleport away while others who needed lilith to teleport were left trapped in the room . \\n `` take care of them '' zeus said to poseidon not once taking his eyes off of me . \\n poseidon nodded and turned towards the remaining enemies . \\n there screams became a background soundtrack to what was happening at the moment . \\n the fear i felt towards the gods had disappeared . \\n ignoring them , i walked pass dyos over to kiowa who lay unconscious on the floor . \\n i kneeled beside her and touched her forehead . \\n she was losing blood . \\n she needed to get to the medic soon . \\n `` we must get rid of him father . '' \\n athena 's voice ranged in my head . \\n `` no ! '' \\n astraea shouted . \\n `` father please , do n't ! '' \\n `` what do you mean no ? '' \\n athena yelled at astraea . \\n `` we have to keep to the bylaws . \\n we must destroy him . '' \\n astraea ignored athena as she made her way over zeus side . \\n `` father he 's not like what we 've heard . \\n father please , just let me explain . '' \\n `` we do n't need an explanation . \\n i shall eradicate him '' poseidon said twirling his staff . \\n dyos stepped in front of me to block me . \\n it was enough to bring a smile to the poseidon 's lips . \\n i moved dyos to the side as i shook my head . \\n i was thankful for his bravery and loyalty , but he would not last against the god . \\n astraea made her way over to us as zeus eyes followed her . \\n she stood in front of me as if shielding me . \\n `` i 'm sorry poseidon , but i ca n't allow you to do that . '' \\n `` you will choose this creature over your own kind . '' \\n astraea turned her eyes to her older sister . \\n `` i 'm not choosing him over my own kind . \\n but i will not stand by and let you hurt him . '' \\n `` you talk as if you have feelings for this him '' astraea did n't reply . \\n athena 's eyes widened as she took a step backwards in shock . \\n throughout it all , zeus remained quiet . \\n `` so it 's true . '' \\n poseidon said staring at astraea . \\n `` you like this demon ! '' \\n `` you do n't have to answer that '' i said suddenly . \\n i would n't stand here and let them force her to admit her feelings in front of me like this . \\n `` you have no part of this ! '' \\n poseidon 's eyes turned towards me . \\n his staff glowed as his eyes flipped fiercely . \\n `` this monstrosity of your creation is already at stake , if i were you i would remain silent until we ask you to speak ! '' \\n `` do n't speak to him like that ! '' \\n astraea shouted . \\n booms sounded behind them as our attention turned towards the hallway . \\n the hallway was dark for a moment before the figure of my father stepped through . \\n at the sight of the gods standing in the room , he came to a stop . \\n his eyes moved around , staring at the gods one by one . \\n his eyes moved over to me and astraea who stood next to my side . \\n anger was in his eyes , but as he stared past me , it changed to grief . \\n he stared at kiowa 's crumpled body in the corner . \\n `` she needs a medic . '' \\n i said . \\n my father 's eyes turned back to me . \\n his eyes roamed over me . \\n there was a look of disgust as he stared at me . \\n with a snap of his fingers , one of the guards who was known as a medic , moved over to kiowa . \\n `` what are you doing on our land ? \\n you have not asked permission to enter our world . '' \\n `` we do not need to ask you for any permission incubus ! '' \\n poseidon said to my father . \\n `` we can enter any world that we please . \\n we are not breaking any rules here . '' \\n my father growled as his true face came forward . \\n the guards behind him mimicked their king as they took a step forward ready to protect and die for him . \\n `` lilith was here . '' \\n i said trying to diffuse another battle . \\n `` she attacked the palace . '' \\n `` where is she ? '' \\n `` she escaped . '' \\n my father scoffed as he stared at zeus in disgust . \\n `` some gods you are . \\n you let her escape when she was right in front of you . \\n i 'm starting to think you enjoy letting the rogue run loose in our world . \\n that way they can exterminate us all without you having to step in and intervene . '' \\n zeus whom had been quiet since his arrival finally spoke . \\n `` i assure you king priam that is not our intent . \\n i came for my daughter , not to exterminate anyone . '' \\n my father 's eyes turned from zeus and looked over to astraea and the way she stood blocking me . \\n `` your daughter has been causing a lot of problems as of late . \\n i do not want her in my world and i do not want her associating with my son . '' \\n `` i assure you she will not return to this world and she will pay for her disobedience . \\n however , i will be taking your son with me . \\n his species is in question and he will need to appear before the courts . '' \\n `` father ! '' \\n astraea cried . \\n `` be silent astraea '' athena said . \\n `` you will not be taking my son anywhere . '' \\n my father said taking a step towards zeus . \\n `` if anyone is going to question him , it will be me . \\n he still has demon blood in his system , of that much i can be sure . \\n as following the bylaws , he is to be questioned by the courts in pearu . '' \\n `` he 's coming with us ! '' \\n poseidon argued . \\n the feel of astraea latching onto my hand made me turn my attention to her . \\n she stared at me , her eyes portraying that she was once again about to do something stupid . \\n as if hearing her plans the gods turned to her . \\n `` i 'm sorry , but i ca n't let you have him ! '' \\n `` no ! '' \\n athena shouted , but it was too late . \\n astraea 's veil formed around us blocking us from the view of the gods as we teleported from the room . \\n fourteen the smell of hay and farm animals surrounded us as we appeared in the middle of a field . \\n a cow mooed , staring at us over the brown wooden fence . \\n astraea let go of my hand as i stared around . \\n `` where are we ? '' \\n i asked . \\n `` in the mortal world . \\n kentucky to be exact . '' \\n she limped over to a fallen log and sat down on it . \\n there was a cut on her leg as blood rushed from it . \\n i 'd almost forgotten that she 's been hurt during her battle with lilith . \\n most of her injuries had healed except for the cut on her leg . \\n `` are you okay ? '' \\n `` i 'll be fine . '' \\n she smiled . \\n `` it 's just taken a bit longer since i used too much power . \\n i should have waited until i was fully healed before cloaking us and teleporting . \\n i just could n't let them take you . '' \\n i sat down on the log beside her as she picked at her cut . \\n i smiled . \\n the act reminded me of one i 'd seen mortal children do many times . \\n `` are you okay ? '' \\n she asked . \\n `` you know with leaving your friend and your mother there . '' \\n `` they will be fine . \\n my father wo n't hurt them . '' \\n it was the truth . \\n while my father might search their memories for any hint of dishonesty or betrayal , if he finds nothing , he will not hurt them . \\n his anger was with me now . \\n i could n't get over the look of disgust on his face as he stared at me . \\n `` he does n't hate you . '' \\n astraea said guessing my thoughts . \\n `` you saw his face . \\n he 's disgusted by me . '' \\n `` no , he 's disgusted by what lurks in your blood . \\n your father still loves you . \\n he even stood up for you against my father . '' \\n i chuckled . \\n `` that was n't for my benefit . \\n my father loves to go against zeus . \\n if he would have said it was nice sunny day , my father would have countered with that it was muggy rainy one . '' \\n `` i do n't think so . \\n you should have more faith in your father aristaeus . '' \\n `` how 's your wound ? '' \\n i asked changing the subject . \\n i did n't want to spend the time thinking about my father right now . \\n astraea stretched out her legs as she wiped the smeared blood off her leg . \\n the cut in her leg was completely healed as if it was never there . \\n i reached out to touch the place where i remember seeing the scar . \\n my fingers brushed against the softness of her skin the silver of my nails shining against her leg . \\n realizing i was caressing her leg , i moved my hand and stared up at astraea . \\n she stared back at me with an inscrutable look , her eyes moving from gold to blue . \\n clearing my throat i said , `` why did you come this time ? \\n i did n't call for you . '' \\n `` i was watching already . \\n i knew i was n't supposed to enter pearu without the authority of my father , but when i saw her hitting on you . \\n i just could n't stand it . '' \\n there was silence between us as unspoken feelings bounced around on the surface . \\n she 'd defied her father rules again because of me . \\n because she could not sit idly by and watch eris kill me . \\n it was the same way i felt when i saw her lying unconscious on the ground . \\n `` i thought you were in trouble for your last act of disobedience . '' \\n `` i was . \\n but my father 's servants have a soft spot for me . \\n they knew i was n't allowed to leave our world anymore , so they did n't feel guilty allowing me to glance in at your world . \\n i 'm sure when i do return they will not trust me anymore . '' \\n `` what is your world like ? '' \\n i asked . \\n `` i know you ca n't say too much about it . \\n i just want to know is similar to that of our world and the mortal world . \\n do you have different parts to your lands like we do ? '' \\n astraea thought about whether or not if she wanted to answer that question or not . \\n `` yes our world is similar more so of that of the mortal world . \\n we have several cities in our land . '' \\n `` i thought you guys would only have one place where all your people would live . '' \\n astraea laughed . \\n `` we might be gods , but we are still children of our true creator . \\n he gives us a chance to enjoy our lives as well . \\n many mortals like to think we sit around and just stare down into the world all day without moving which is only halfway true . \\n we take shifts with the other species in our world . '' \\n `` what other species do you guys have ? '' \\n `` now that i ca n't answer . '' \\n i nodded . \\n `` i understand . \\n do you enjoy it there ? '' \\n `` yeah , i love my world . \\n why do you ask ? '' \\n i shrugged . \\n `` it just seems like you 're always trying to escape it . '' \\n `` i 'm not trying to escape my world . \\n the only times i 've left was when you needed me . \\n our world is so peaceful . \\n i would n't trade it for that of the mortal world like others would . \\n i love being close to my kind and close to the creator . '' \\n `` have you seen him ? \\n your creator ? '' \\n astraea stared at me . \\n `` he 's just not our creator , aristaeus . \\n he 's yours too . \\n and to answer your question , no i have n't seen him . '' \\n i scoffed . \\n `` what is it with gods and not revealing themselves ? \\n i understand why you do n't show yourselves to mortals , they would n't be able to handle it . \\n but to the creatures of pearu , we do n't care how you look . \\n it 's better for us actually to know how you look so we can know our enemy . '' \\n `` am i your enemy aristaeus ? '' \\n `` no , i was n't saying that . \\n i was just speaking in terms of the creatures of pearu . '' \\n `` hmm . '' \\n astraea mused . \\n `` well you seemed to answer the question for yourself . \\n we do not reveal ourselves because mortals would not be able to handle our true form . \\n it 's the same reason those of the damned do not show their true forms to the mortals . '' \\n `` it 's not like we do n't want to . \\n it just goes against the rules of your father . '' \\n a hawk settled on a chopped true stump and stared over at us . \\n its head turned to the side as trying to figure out what exactly where we . \\n the way it turned its head reminded me of lilith . \\n `` lilith seemed shocked by my change . \\n it was like she was n't expecting it which was confusing since she was the one who seemed to think i was something different . '' \\n `` i noticed . \\n your change shocked a lot of people . '' \\n i turned to stare at astraea . \\n `` everyone that is , except you . \\n you seemed okay by change . '' \\n astraea stared at her hands but did n't bother to answer me . \\n `` astraea , you know what am i am , do n't you ? '' \\n she looked up at me as if she was sad . \\n `` can we talk about something else please ? '' \\n `` no . \\n now answer me . \\n do you know what i am ? '' \\n `` yes . '' \\n `` what am i ? '' \\n `` i ca n't tell you that aristaeus . '' \\n she said . \\n `` you wo n't , or you ca n't . '' \\n `` i wo n't . '' \\n i sighed and rubbed a hand through my hair . \\n i 'd yet look at the new me . \\n from what i could tell , i still the same , but there was still something different in me . \\n everyone else seemed to see it . \\n everyone seemed to know what i was , except me . \\n `` please do n't be angry with me aristaeus . '' \\n astraea said softly . \\n `` i want to tell you but i ca n't . '' \\n `` why ? \\n is it against one of your rules ? '' \\n `` no it 's not one of our rules . \\n i 'm just worried about how you will view yourself . \\n i 'm worried about what you will do and how this change will affect you . '' \\n `` what do you mean ? '' \\n `` this change is something that has never happened ever in our existence though it has been spoken of . '' \\n `` so you 're saying i 'm a myth ? '' \\n astraea nodded . \\n `` yes and since i do n't have all the information yet , i do n't feel comfortable telling you . \\n you 're going to want answers to questions i do n't have . '' \\n i stared at her . \\n i knew she was just looking out for me . \\n she was right as well . \\n whatever i am , i was going to ask questions about how i 'd gotten this . \\n whatever kind of mythical creature i was seemed to bring fear to both the lilith and the gods . \\n i slightly wondered if this grethen knew this when he brought me to my father that night . \\n `` who is grethen ? '' \\n astraea asked reading my thoughts . \\n `` he was a member of my father 's courant . \\n he was the one who brought me to my mother when she could n't have off springs of her own . '' \\n `` where did he get you from ? '' \\n the vision i 'd seen in the heart came to me as i blinked my eyes closed . \\n `` it 's okay aristaeus . \\n you do n't have to tell me if you 're not ready . '' \\n i rubbed my hands across my face . \\n i brought my hands down and stared at the moonstone ring on my finger . \\n `` it 's not that . \\n i want to tell you . \\n i just do n't have all the parts to the puzzle yet . \\n i 'm still confused on what i saw myself . '' \\n astraea reached over and rubbed my shoulder in comfort . \\n `` do not stress yourself over this . \\n together we 'll find out what happened to you , and what all of this mean . \\n it ca n't be just a coincidence , your birth that is . '' \\n i nodded . \\n it was something that ran through my mind as well . \\n my birth and the vision of kithara was n't an accident . \\n there was something else missing . \\n i was here for a purpose , whatever that seemed to be . \\n `` i wonder where lilith disappeared to . '' \\n `` she 's probably gone into hiding . \\n she was n't expecting zeus to appear in our world . \\n i do n't think anyone was prepared for that surprise . '' \\n astraea sighed . \\n `` my father came because of me . \\n he 's connected to all of his children . \\n so when one of us is down , he automatically feels it . \\n once my shield was down he knew exactly where i was . \\n it only took him a second for him to get here . '' \\n `` what do you think he will do to you this time ? '' \\n `` i 'm not sure . \\n i 've disobeyed him too many times . \\n it was one thing to do it in front of lilith , but in front of creatures of pearu . \\n he wo n't let this go so easily like he 's done all the other times . '' \\n `` i 'll defend you . '' \\n i said fiercely but astraea simply waved her hand . \\n `` will you go back home ? '' \\n `` not right now . \\n i need to let my father calm down some . \\n besides he needs to spend more time with kiowa . \\n she 's going to need him when she wakes up . \\n she 's never experienced anything of that sort before . '' \\n `` she seems really sweet to be a demon . '' \\n astraea said smiling . \\n `` i 've seen her often around you . \\n she reminds me so much of some of the mortal mothers i 've seen . '' \\n `` do n't let her hear that , she 'll have your head . '' \\n we both laughed as the cows behind the fence begin to push closer . \\n they seemed to find us intriguing to the point they were trying to break the fence . \\n `` i heard what she said . '' \\n `` hmm '' i turned to astraea . \\n `` you heard what who said ? '' \\n `` your mother . \\n i heard what she said about being okay with you having feelings for me . '' \\n i stared at her as she ducked her head in embarrassment . \\n `` i know i should n't have invaded your privacy , i 'm sorry . \\n i was just watching you when she said that . '' \\n `` no ... it 's okay . \\n you do n't have to be sorry . '' \\n `` aristaeus . '' \\n astraea called softly . \\n i glanced over at her . \\n she moved around nervously like a mortal . \\n whatever she was about to say both frightened and excited her . \\n `` yes . '' \\n `` i ... i like you aristaeus . '' \\n she lifted her head to stare at me as her eyes shined bright with each change of color . \\n `` i ... i really like you . '' \\n as i stared at her , the thought came to me that we were trouble . \\n this could n't happen . \\n a god and a hell demon with feelings for each other . \\n things like this just did n't happen . \\n it was unheard of and it was blasphemy . \\n even as i thought all of this , i could n't stop my head nearing towards hers . \\n i watched her eyes move from my eyes to my lips as she leaned closer . \\n our lips touched and we both sighed with contentment . \\n yup , we were in deep trouble . \\n my hand grabbed the back of her head as i pulled her closer to me . \\n her hand reached up to grip my shirt as we pushed to get closer to each other . \\n our lips continued to entwine as i tried to install this scene in every part of my memory i could . \\n i did n't want to forget this moment . \\n my chest felt as if it was about to burst and my hands would n't stop moving from her head to her face . \\n she was beautiful . \\n this kiss was beautiful . \\n for once i experience the love that mortals dreamed of . \\n her lips were soft against mine as we they took the time to get to know mine better . \\n i did n't want this to end . \\n the clearing of someone 's voice forced us apart . \\n i leaped up and withdrew my demos blocking astraea from the intruder 's view . \\n i was expecting to see lilith again , but instead , zeus stood in front of us . \\n embarrassment from being caught kissing his daughter went through me until i remembered he and the rest of the gods wanted me dead . \\n `` father '' astraea called from behind me . \\n zeus stared at us his eyes narrowing at the both of us . \\n he was alone . \\n `` astraea you are to return home at once . '' \\n `` father please let me explain . \\n you do not understand . '' \\n `` i understand enough ! '' \\n his voice came out sharply . \\n thunder boomed in the sky as astraea whimpered . \\n `` you continue to disobey me over and over and i have gone easy on you because i thought you were just humoring yourself . '' \\n `` i 'm sorry father . '' \\n `` i do not want to hear any of your apologies . \\n you will find someone waiting for you when you return home . \\n you will not be leaving again . \\n i will make sure of it this time . '' \\n i turned to look back at astraea whose head was bent as tears ran down her face . \\n it was killing her to go against her father and it was enough to feel me with guilt . \\n she was doing this for me . \\n `` go . '' \\n i said quietly to her . \\n `` i will be okay . '' \\n astraea 's head lifted as she stared at me . \\n she shook her head fiercely . \\n `` no i wo n't . \\n i wo n't let anyone harm you ! '' \\n out of the corner of my eye , i watched zeus remove a golden rope similar to that of my jugest . \\n i heard astraea gasped behind me . \\n the rope shot out of zeus hand towards astraea . \\n the rope wrapped around her leg as she was yanked forward by zeus . \\n `` no ! '' \\n i screamed . \\n i ran at zeus who threw a bolt at me . \\n the impact from the bolt sent me flying in the air as i landed in a pile of logs . \\n i peered up as astraea had now reached zeus feet . \\n lightning flashed in the sky as it cleared and two forms of light shot out . \\n the light landed next to zeus feet to reveal to beings i 've never seen before . \\n they were dressed in white armor and there face was covered by a white and gold helmet . \\n bright white wings were attached to their back and seemed to stretch wider than any wings i 'd seen before . \\n they ran forward and latched onto astraea 's arms . \\n with a wail , gold light formed around them as they shot towards the sky leaving me alone with zeus . \\n `` no ! '' \\n i got up from the ground . \\n i ran at zeus . \\n i threw my fists at him as he blocked them without really laying a hand on me . \\n `` what did you do to her ? '' \\n `` she disobeyed me . \\n i will not tolerate disobedience from anyone . '' \\n i did n't bother to respond as i threw punches at me . \\n zeus got tired of my hits as he swatted me to the side . \\n i crashed into the fence that held the cows . \\n the cows did n't seem to mind my intruding as they began to lick and chew on my hair . \\n `` do not worry yourself aristaeus . \\n i will not harm her , at least not in the way your father does to you . '' \\n zeus sat down on the log astraea and i had been sharing . \\n `` i know you have feelings for my daughter and she has feelings for you as well . '' \\n i pushed up from the ground and slapped a cow that was still chewing on my hair . \\n i made my way towards zeus ready to take him on again though i doubt i will win , even with my new strength . \\n `` you 're not their blood son . '' \\n `` i thought you already knew i was n't there son . '' \\n `` believe it or not aristaeus , your father does know how to keep some secrets from me . \\n i thought of you to be a full blooded hell demon . '' \\n `` and now ? '' \\n i asked . \\n `` and now you 're something that is not supposed to exist . \\n it seems my daughter discovered it before me , but yet she has been an observing one . '' \\n `` and yet you sent her away without letting her explain . '' \\n `` i had to . \\n i could n't have her associating with an abomination . \\n a sacrilege at that . '' \\n zeus said . \\n i stared at him . \\n `` what did you call me ? \\n i would n't have thought a high god of your level would resort to name calling . \\n i thought only poseidon does that ? '' \\n `` i am not calling you that to pick on you . \\n i 'm calling you that , because it 's what you are . \\n you 're a sacrilege aristaeus . '' \\n `` sacrilege ? \\n what does that mean ? \\n `` you 're no longer just a hell demon , you 're a god . '' \\n fifteen i stared at zeus as shock went through me . \\n my mouth opened and closed several times as i tried to find the words to disagree , but they never came . \\n i wanted to tell him he was wrong , but as i looked in his eyes , i knew he was n't . \\n `` i know it 's hard to come to terms with . \\n imagine how i felt once i discovered your true identity . '' \\n zeus said catching a grasshopper in his hands . \\n the grasshopper 's leg was broken , but with a touch from the god , its leg outstretched completely healed . \\n he placed the bug down and sent it on its way . \\n `` i had my suspicions . \\n i just needed them to be confirmed . '' \\n `` you had your suspicions . '' \\n i finally breathed out . \\n `` yes . \\n my daughter is not one to react in such a way that she would disobey me . \\n if it was anyone that would disobey me , it would be athena . \\n astraea is like my shadow . \\n i can always count on her to be around me . \\n but with the sudden appearance of you , she began to leave my side . \\n it started as just every once in a while that she would sneak off to watch you . \\n i did n't mind it then . \\n it was once you started to become of adult age , when you started your first job as a reaper . \\n my daughter sensed your empathy towards the mortals , in that she found you interesting . '' \\n i moved closer to him , my thirst for knowledge overriding the anger i had been feeling towards the god . \\n i sat on the edge of the log as he continued his story . \\n `` she used to come to us and tell us all the things you were feeling . \\n i like her , found it quite strange that a hell demon would be harboring such intense feelings for mortals . \\n especially the son of king priam . \\n i take it your family did not know of your feelings . '' \\n `` not at first . '' \\n i said . \\n `` i hid it from them , but they eventually found out . '' \\n `` i figured as much . \\n i guess my daughter is to be blamed for part of that . \\n after watching you so long , i should have known she would have ventured down sooner or later to meet you . \\n the gates being broken was the perfect excuse for her to see you . \\n though i was upset with her for cloaking herself from me while she was with you the first time , i understood -- which is why i did n't push so hard to punish her once she returned home . \\n it was after she defied me again that i began to worry . \\n you remember our first meeting , do n't you ? '' \\n `` how could i forget ? '' \\n i said . \\n `` it was my first showdown with lilith . '' \\n zeus laughed at my terminology as he stared up at the sky . \\n `` you speak like mortals . \\n yes , we met during the `` showdown '' with lilith . \\n i did n't have much time to watch you , as you can see i was busy defending my children against a enemy . \\n it was n't until you call forth a power that i possessed that i began to find you quite interesting . \\n you have no idea the shock i faced watching and feeling you do that . '' \\n `` feeling ? '' \\n `` lightning , thunder , all those powers are connected to me . \\n they are a part of me . \\n so when you call forth a power that only i use , i felt it all over my body , it was as if you were pulling it from me . '' \\n `` i 'm sorry . '' \\n i said thinking of the pain he must have felt . \\n `` no worries . \\n it was n't painful . \\n it was a shock , but it was n't painful . '' \\n `` is that when you started watching me ? '' \\n `` yes . \\n when we returned home , i sent astraea off so i could think . \\n i could hear the worries in her head about what she thought i would do to you . \\n it felt a bit strange the way my daughter felt for you . \\n it was too much to deal with at that moment . \\n i shut myself off of the world for two days as i sat there and tried to figure you out . \\n i 've never seen a creature of the damned use such power before . \\n it was new but not particularly unheard of . \\n can you think of a case i might be talking about ? '' \\n `` eris . '' \\n i said remembering what i 'd read in my father 's diary pages . \\n `` yes . \\n eris was the first creature of the damned to possess such skills that only a god could possess . \\n however , unlike you , her powers created with potions , while yours were born as part of you . \\n she no doubt had help from her baba yaga friend . \\n after learning of the baba yaga being in your world , i needed confirmation . \\n i knew my daughter well enough to know that despite my warnings she would go to you . \\n i just needed to wait . \\n when lilith attacked your palace , i armed myself and waited for astraea to leave . \\n she did not disappoint . '' \\n `` and then you saw what i was . '' \\n `` and then i saw what you were . '' \\n zeus agreed . \\n i stared down at my hand as i stroked the moonstone . \\n `` it was this ring . \\n it changed me . '' \\n `` it was n't the ring aristaeus , though it did help . \\n the power has been in you all along -- the ring just sparked it fully . \\n it 's your life source if you will . '' \\n `` life source ? '' \\n `` yes . \\n every god has some form of object that gives their power life . '' \\n `` you talk as if it 's alive . '' \\n i said chuckling . \\n `` it is . \\n like mortals have their organs they need to live , our life source is our organ . \\n it helps us function . \\n without it we will be weak , but not completely unarmed . '' \\n `` you seem pretty confident telling me this . \\n i am still part hell demon . \\n i could use this information against you . '' \\n zeus chuckled . \\n `` i am not worried about that dear prince . \\n while you are half god , i am full god . \\n if i wanted to , i could strike you down . '' \\n the two of us got quiet as the slight threat hung in the air . \\n though he was being kind to me at the moment , he still did not want me to forget just who and what he was . \\n `` so tell me more about a sacrilege . \\n why am i a myth ? '' \\n `` it was once said that before the creator fashioned gods and demons , he created another being . \\n this being was supposed to bring peace between both gods and demons . \\n it was supposed to be a balance . \\n however , the universe did not seem to be able to handle the construction of this creature , so instead of presenting the creator with a peaceful creature , they presented a creature so powerful that he could destroy both species . \\n the creator thought if he placed this creature in his separate world that things would go smoothly , but before he could seal him in , the creature burst from the world destroying not only his world , but the first creation of the mortal world . \\n it soon became clear to the creator that his universe was not ready for this type of creature , so he removed the creature from existence taking the creature 's soul , keeping it in a box . \\n on the fourth day of the creation of earth , the creator traveled down and headed to one of the great bodies of water that ran through the mortal world . \\n it is there creator buried the soul of the creature . \\n the soul was to sit there and remain until the creator took it from its resting place . \\n the creator returned home , and the next day we received word on what was to happen if we were to see the creature . \\n it was one of the highest threats to the creator , so we were always on the lookout for it . \\n this creature was an abomination to those of gods and demons earning it the name sacrilege . \\n the creature had remained a myth for several centuries , until now . '' \\n i took in everything zeus was saying . \\n i wondered why no one in our world has ever mentioned the myth of the sacrilege . \\n i thought about the creator traveling down to the mortal world to hide the soul of the sacrilege . \\n i wondered for a second which body of water it was that the creator hid the box in ? \\n was it the same place where kithara said she was going ? \\n i remembered her repeating her orders to the woman in my dreams as they stood on the hill staring out at the sea . \\n `` you dreamed of this ? '' \\n zeus said hearing my thoughts . \\n clearing my throat i stared over at him . \\n i was caught so there was no point in denying anything . \\n `` i think i did . \\n i had a vision a couple of days ago when i touched something in my father 's study . \\n it took me to the mortal world but everything was in black in white . \\n kithara was the only bit of color i could see . '' \\n `` kithara ? '' \\n `` yes . \\n she was a kampe . \\n i think she left pearu two days after you sealed the gates . '' \\n zeus raised a finger to his lip as he looked off into the trees . \\n `` yes , i do seem to remember that . \\n the gates were damaged with so much strength that it seemed as if a god had done it . \\n we instantly thought it was eris and continued to search for her , but she kept herself hidden well . '' \\n `` how is that possible ? \\n how can she hide yourself from you ? '' \\n `` eris is a creature of many talents and seems to only be getting stronger . \\n while i ca n't see her right now , our creator is watching her . '' \\n `` well why is n't this creator stopping her ? '' \\n i asked confused . \\n `` why is she allowed to create havoc in our worlds ? '' \\n `` the creator created us so we could handle our own situations . \\n like mortals we choose our own paths . \\n it is up to us how we end up . '' \\n `` that does n't make any sense . '' \\n zeus smiled . \\n `` you were telling me about this kampe . '' \\n `` right . \\n i followed her in the vision through the mortal world as she headed towards a mortal hospital . \\n i found it strange that this was the place she 'd chosen . \\n she headed towards the newborn floor were the sick baby mortals were and barricaded herself in . \\n i watched her wait for a male baby she 'd chosen heartbeat to slow . \\n i remembered thinking about the reaper , and why he was n't waiting for the infant 's soul . \\n but i forgot all of that when i saw her place a golden globe inside of the baby 's body . '' \\n `` a golden globe ? '' \\n `` yes . \\n she took it from a silver box . \\n she waited for the baby 's soul to leave its body before replacing it with that of the golden light . '' \\n zeus got quiet again . \\n he was thinking the same thing i was . \\n that baby in that nursery , the one kithara traded souls were , was me . \\n `` what happened to this kampe ? '' \\n `` she met up with lilith . '' \\n i did n't need to say more . \\n we both know what seemed to happen when someone met up with the baba yaga . \\n `` you said you saw her with another woman . '' \\n i nodded . \\n `` it was a dream i had last night before the attack happened . \\n kithara was alive and well . \\n she was in this place that seemed like earth , but it was n't . \\n kithara described it as peaceful . \\n even though i was n't actually there , i too felt it . \\n i felt comfortable . \\n i felt safe . '' \\n i stared over at zeus who 'd tensed when i mentioned this place . \\n his hands balled into fists as his eyes darted back and forth . \\n `` are you okay ? '' \\n i asked . \\n `` i 'm fine . \\n continue with your story . '' \\n i gave him another glance . \\n he was not fine . \\n something was up . \\n `` in the dream kithara went to join this woman who was standing near the end of a hill enjoying the breeze of the sea . \\n i could n't see her face . \\n it seemed every time i tried , something pushed me away . \\n it felt strange . '' \\n `` what did they talk about ? '' \\n zeus asked hoarsely . \\n `` i do n't know . \\n it was a bit confusing . \\n they kept talking about change and stopping eris . \\n this woman , though i could n't see her , she seemed to be the one in charge of whatever was going on and she had allies . \\n kithara said it in the dream . \\n they also mentioned a box somewhere in atlantis . \\n i thought that place was a myth but i guess not . '' \\n `` this woman , are you sure you did not see her face . '' \\n `` i 'm sure . \\n i could only see her black hair and the outline of her body against the sunlight . \\n her face was blurred to me . '' \\n zeus suddenly stood . \\n `` tell no one else of what you 've seen . '' \\n `` i do n't understand . \\n what 's going on ? '' \\n `` i am not sure , but i am to find out . \\n are you sure lilith killed this creature kithara ? '' \\n `` i 'm sure . '' \\n i said . \\n `` she beheaded her and teleported away . '' \\n `` yes , that does seem like a baba yaga . '' \\n zeus turned to stare at me . \\n `` do not worry yourself too much over this aristaeus . \\n i will get to the bottom of this and take care of it . \\n in the meantime , i want you to return home . '' \\n `` no , i ca n't return home . \\n not now . '' \\n `` i ca n't allow you to stay in the mortal world unsupervised . '' \\n `` why not ? \\n i 've never done anything to hurt any mortals . \\n i 'm not a danger to them . '' \\n `` have you not listened to a word i 've said ? '' \\n zeus said staring at me . \\n `` you 're a sacrilege . \\n you 're not just a danger to mortals now , but to gods and demons both . \\n it 's best you return home before someone gets hurt . '' \\n i stared at the hidden message in his words . \\n `` by hurting someone , do you mean astraea ? '' \\n zeus turned his head to the side as if he did not want to answer me . \\n i scoffed . \\n `` i would never hurt astraea . \\n i 've been alone with her several times and could have hurt her then , but i did n't . \\n i care for her . \\n i would never hurt her . '' \\n `` i 'm sure you think this aristaeus , however i can not risk it . \\n not until i know the full extent of your powers and what purpose you were created for ? '' \\n `` so what , am i supposed to just return back to pearu and await trial ? '' \\n `` yes . '' \\n i shook my head as i tried to think of another way to get the god to understand i would not danger his daughter . \\n i felt like a mortal male who was trying to get a father to let me date his daughter . \\n zeus read my thoughts and chuckled . \\n `` if only it was that easy . '' \\n `` what can i do for you to trust me ? \\n to trust that i want hurt your daughter . '' \\n `` accept your god side fully . \\n it is only then that i will trust you with my daughter . '' \\n i stared at zeus to see if he was joking but there was no smile on his lips . \\n he meant what he said . \\n i could n't even picture myself living as only a god , and i think he seemed to know this which was why he suggested it . \\n `` see you ca n't do it . \\n so please just accept what i say . '' \\n i nodded . \\n `` you 'll have to erase my memory , i ca n't ... i ca n't return home with the information we 've talked about floating around in my head . \\n my father would see it . '' \\n `` you could block it , but that would take too much time to teach you . \\n another time then . '' \\n zeus walked over to me and raised a hand to my head . \\n `` wait ! '' \\n he paused and stared at me his eyes going from brown to black . \\n i wondered if my eyes changed colors now . \\n i 'd been through all of this and have yet to see the new change in me . \\n `` this woman , the woman i seen in my dreams . \\n is she samr ? '' \\n `` how do you know of samr ? '' \\n `` i 've read her name in my father 's diary . \\n he overheard eris say it one day when she was still queen . \\n she was talking about killing you and her . '' \\n `` hmm '' `` who is she ? '' \\n i asked . \\n `` she is no one you need to worry about . '' \\n i shook my head and took a step back . \\n `` you 're withholding information god . \\n this woman is more than just a nobody if eris was after her . \\n she 's gotten onto her radar and somehow i heard her speaking to me . '' \\n that seemed to grab zeus attention . \\n `` you heard her speaking to you ? '' \\n `` yes , but i 'm not telling you what she said until you tell me who she is . '' \\n `` there is no need for you to keep secrets since i 've already read what she said in your head . '' \\n i sighed in frustration . \\n i had to learn how to block my thoughts . \\n i peered at zeus trying to break into his thoughts . \\n i 'd done it once back at the palace , but now it seemed impossible . \\n `` you caught me off guard . '' \\n he said . \\n `` it will not happen again . '' \\n `` never say never god . '' \\n zeus laughed and raised his hand to place it on my head . \\n `` before you send me home , i thought you should know that kithara cared for this woman . \\n kithara , a creature of the damned , felt love for this woman . \\n she was a mother to her . \\n so despite you trying to keep who this woman is from me , i know one thing . \\n i know whoever she is -- she does n't wish to bring harm to anyone . \\n she also was the one who help me changed . \\n i 'm saying all of this to say , even though you wo n't tell me who she is , does n't mean i 'm going to stop trying to figure out who she is . '' \\n zeus smiled down at me . \\n `` i ca n't wait to see what you come up with sacrilege . \\n until then . '' \\n there was a slight pressure on my head as something flashed in front of my eyes , and then i was home . \\n i was back in pearu . \\n part two s a c r i l e g e beyond this place of wrath and tears looms but the horror of the shade , and yet the menace of the years finds , and shall find , me unafraid . \\n invictus-by william earnest henley sixteen the minute i appeared in pearu , i was swarmed by my father 's guards . \\n i raised my hands in surrender as they tackled me to the ground . \\n as they began to search me , i tried to ignore the fact that my father was treating me like a common criminal . \\n i could n't blame him too much though . \\n if i was in his position , i probably would have done worst , but since i was n't in his position , i felt a bit of betrayal and sadness . \\n `` let 's go ! '' \\n the guard said yanking me up . \\n `` how is the queen ? \\n did the medic get to her in time ? '' \\n `` quiet ! '' \\n the guard stared at me in the same way my father had . \\n somehow i 'd gone from being their prince to someone lower than a servant . \\n the guards did n't seem to have a carriage with them , so we had to walk to the palace . \\n i did n't seem to mind since it gave me some time to get my thoughts together before i greeted my father . \\n my mind was a bit frazzled on what had happened . \\n the last thing i could remember is being at the palace during the attack . \\n lilith was there . \\n the gods were there . \\n astraea was there . \\n astraea . \\n i remember going off with her , but i could n't remember where . \\n i was so wrapped in my thoughts that i 'd tripped over my legs . \\n i fell down bring along one of the guards that was holding my arm . \\n the guard got up and sent a kick to my side . \\n `` get up ! '' \\n `` you sure you want to kick your future king . '' \\n `` you 'll never be king aristaeus . \\n no one will stand with you after finding out that you consort with gods . \\n besides , it was your father who gave us permission to treat you any way that we would like . \\n now get up ! '' \\n the guard yanked me up as i thought about killing him and escorting myself to the palace . \\n we started back walking as i turned to glance at the other guards . \\n they all had a look of anger and disgust on their face as they stared at me . \\n i knew the anger came from some of their fallen soldiers even though i do not see how i could be blamed for something like that . \\n lilith had taken out the majority and the rest decided to trade the loyalties determining their own fate . \\n i would not apologize to them about the latter -- i did feel sorry for the ones that stuck by the king until their death . \\n i wanted to say this to them , but i knew they would n't want to hear it . \\n we reached the palace as the bridge was let down . \\n the bridge fell into place with a loud bang as we began to cross it quickly . \\n the moment the last guard foot left the bridge , it was being lifted back up . \\n my father was n't taking any chances with lilith . \\n she could return at any minute , even though i 'm sure the last time she did not use the bridge to get onto our land . \\n climbing the steps to the palace , new servants opened the doors stepping to the side . \\n the halls were still covered in debris , but most of it was being cleaned up . \\n there were n't any dead bodies lying around , and i knew they 'd been taken out where they would be burned . \\n the guards led me down the hall past my father 's study , down to the dungeons . \\n around me there were new faces of guards and servants . \\n i spotted a few familiar faces in the crowd , but at the sight of me , they turned their heads . \\n we arrived at the dungeons as the guards open the door to the cell . \\n `` home sweet home '' he grinned , his sharp teeth stained . \\n they shoved me in as i caught my balance before falling completely over . \\n the door slammed behind me shutting me in . \\n i was thankful this time they did n't bother to chain me to the walls . \\n i made my way over to the bench towards the back of the wall and sat . \\n rubbing my hands over my face , i sighed . \\n when did my life get so confusing ? \\n i remember wishing for something better , some kind of excitement in my life . \\n now that i have it , i wanted to give it away . \\n i guess that 's why the mortals say , `` be careful for what you wish for . '' \\n a noise came from the next cell beside me as i waited in the room for a little while more . \\n the door opened and the same guards entered the room . \\n `` on your feet for the king . '' \\n i stood from the bench as the guards stepped to the side and allowed room for the king . \\n my father stepped through the doors , his eyes immediately landing on me . \\n `` leave us . '' \\n the guards bowed and stepped outside the doors , closing it behind them . \\n they would n't go far . \\n they did n't trust me and there was no way they were leaving me alone with their king . \\n left alone with my father , i widened my stance as i waited for him to make the first move . \\n as i waited , my eyes took him in . \\n despite all that has happened -- he was still dressed to perfection . \\n he wore his purple blazer coat as his white collar shirt puffed out the top . \\n his hair fell neatly to his shoulders and his nails seemed sharper than usual . \\n the only thing that seemed to point out how he was suffering was his eyes . \\n the dullness of his eyes was something that i 'd seen before on my father . \\n if he 'd been mortal , i 'm sure there would have been wrinkles around his eyes . \\n `` sit . '' \\n he finally spoke . \\n i sat down on the bench keeping my legs wide . \\n i place my hands on my knees to show my father that i did not have any weapons and that i was not about to attack him . \\n `` how is mother ? '' \\n he pulled a chair over a few feet in front of me and took a seat . \\n i thought he would ignore my question , but he did n't . \\n `` she will be fine . \\n she is still healing . \\n she is mostly worried about you . \\n it is because of her request that i have not had you killed . '' \\n `` you would do that ? \\n you would kill your son ? '' \\n `` you are not my son aristaeus , surely you know this now . '' \\n my eyes searched his as tried to figure out whether or not he knew i 'd been down in the hidden room under his study . \\n `` i am still your son despite my mysterious birth . '' \\n `` that is up to me to decide , not you . '' \\n `` how is dyos ? \\n is he okay ? '' \\n `` your friend is okay . \\n he like kiowa has pleaded that i give you the chance to explain before ordering you to death . '' \\n i stared at my father with sadness . \\n `` so you mean to tell me that you do not care whether or not if i live or die . '' \\n my father said nothing . \\n he only stared at me which seemed to piss me off . \\n i shook my head at the unfairness of all of this . \\n it was n't like i asked to be brought to him . \\n i was a victim in this situation just like he was . \\n `` i guess i should have known you would feel that way . \\n you 've never shown any signs that you cared about me before i changed , so why would i think you would be any different . \\n i 'm surprised you even showed any emotion when it came to seeing kiowa unconscious , since you ignore her and act as if you do not love her any other time . \\n i guess i should be happy that you at least have some type of feelings for you wife , even though you do not care much for your son . '' \\n `` i did not come down here to have a heart to heart with you about my feelings aristaeus . \\n i come to listen to you explain . \\n so explain . '' \\n i took a glance at my father as he leaned back in his chair and crossed his legs . \\n he stared across at me as if he would rather be anywhere than down here with me at this moment . \\n `` i do n't know what you want to know . \\n i do n't know how this change happen , only that it happen . '' \\n `` do you honestly expect me to believe that aristaeus ? '' \\n `` you can believe what you want father . \\n you will anyway . '' \\n i said . \\n `` why do n't we hurry and get this over with by having you read my mind ? \\n that way you wo n't have to worry about if i 'm keeping things from you . '' \\n `` i 'm glad you made the suggestion . '' \\n my father stood quickly and before i knew it he was in front of me . \\n he placed a hand in front of my face and closed his eyes . \\n i felt my thoughts being pulled to him as flashes flew across my mind . \\n once the last image was out , i felt my body sink back against the wall . \\n my father turned away from and folded his arms behind his back . \\n `` see . \\n i told you the truth . \\n i do not know anything about this transformation . \\n i 'm just as lost as you are . '' \\n `` you know something . \\n your mind has been tampered with again . \\n i can feel it . '' \\n he turned back to face me . \\n `` when lilith was here , did she get the chance to touch your mind ? '' \\n `` i do not know . \\n she did place me under a spell that paralyzed me for a long time . \\n do you think that could have had some effect on my memory ? '' \\n `` could be . '' \\n `` how is it that she can do those things ? \\n i know she 's not of this world , but should n't her powers be taken once she 'd entered pearu ? '' \\n `` some would say the same thing about you aristaeus when it comes to your powers . '' \\n i sighed as i rubbed a hand through my hair . \\n `` you still did not answer my question . '' \\n `` i do not know how lilith or even eris can do the things they can . \\n eris is the original ruler of pearu . \\n she is bound to possess skills that i can not possess even as king . \\n the fact that she 's befriended a witch seemed to have strengthen her powers . '' \\n `` you 're not telling me everything father . \\n i know you 're not . '' \\n my father turned to stare at me as he tried to read my thoughts . \\n `` you 've been in my study . '' \\n `` of course i 've been in your study , you left me there remember ? '' \\n `` do not play dumb with me aristaeus . '' \\n my father crossed over to me as his eyes peered into mine . \\n `` how did you discover that room ? \\n what were you looking for ? '' \\n i moved around on the bench nervously as my eyes darted away from my fathers . \\n i 'd forgotten all about hiding trying to hide that particular memory from my father . \\n i knew i could n't avoid this question . \\n he would want answers and if i did not give them to him , he would pick my brain apart until he got what he wanted . \\n `` i 've always knew you had a hidden room somewhere in the palace , i just happened to see the secret latch on your throne chair . '' \\n `` what were you looking for ? '' \\n `` at first , i just wanted to see if the room was there and what was in it . \\n after that , i wanted to find information on eris . \\n i could see she was beginning to stress you out which is rare for you . \\n i wanted to find some information on her so that i could help you stop her . '' \\n `` i have told you to stay out of this several times ! '' \\n my father yelled . \\n `` you do not seem to listen to anything i say ! \\n eris is not your problem to fix , she is mine . '' \\n i jumped up to face my father . \\n `` with all due respect father , she became my problem the moment her friend lilith started to take interest in me . '' \\n my father eyes narrowed as he raised a finger to point at me . \\n `` you are to stay away from eris and that baba yaga , do you understand me . \\n those two are far more dangerous than which you believe . \\n do you think the witch 's little appearance at the palace was by coincidence ? \\n do you think that just because you seem to injure her during battle , that you can take her out ? \\n if so , you might as well remove such pointless thoughts from your head . \\n she was just humoring you . \\n this whole battle was just her way of entertaining herself . \\n there is a bigger picture here , and until i know what it is , you are to stay away from her and away from that god . '' \\n he was talking about astraea . \\n the mention of her once again had me trying to remember where we had disappeared to after leaving the palace . \\n why was that part of my memory blurred ? \\n i could see slight flashes but not the full image . \\n did she erase my memory ? \\n if so did i ask her ? \\n `` aristaeus are you listening to me ? '' \\n i turned my attention back to my father . \\n `` i will stay away from them for now , but you have to tell me all that you know about eris and lilith . \\n i have the right to know . '' \\n my father stared at me before nodding . \\n `` i will tell you , but not now . \\n for now , you need to go see kiowa and your friend . \\n they 've been waiting to meet with you . '' \\n `` so i 'm allowed to go free . \\n you 're not going to have me jailed or killed . '' \\n `` i have n't made up my mind yet . '' \\n my father turned to leave towards the door when i said . \\n `` you were never going to sentenced me to death , were you ? '' \\n my father turned his head slightly , a hint of a smile around his lips , before exiting the room leaving the door opened for me . \\n i found myself smiling , and then headed to exit the room . \\n i entered my parent 's bedroom and stopped inside the door . \\n the last time i 'd been allowed into their room or even in their quarters , was when i was young . \\n ever since then , my father would not allow me to enter their quarters . \\n he 'd never given me a good reason , only that i had my own quarters , why did i need to enter his . \\n kiowa lay in her bed as servants moved around her , patting her head with a cool cloth , and picking up the dirty laundry . \\n her eyes traveled over to the door and she gave a half smile . \\n `` aristaeus . '' \\n the servants turned to stare at me , their eyes filled with distrust . \\n was there anyone in this palace that still trusted me ? \\n `` leave us '' the servants bowed to the queen and hurried towards the door giving me a half bow before disappearing out the door and closing it behind them . \\n kiowa held out her hand beckoning me to her , and i made my way over . \\n i grabbed a nearby chair and placed it beside her bed . \\n i sat down on the chair and took her outstretched hand in mind before placing it on my face . \\n i missed her . \\n i missed when things were simple . \\n `` i 'm glad you 're okay aristaeus . '' \\n i looked up at her . \\n `` i should be the one saying that . \\n you 're the one lying up in the bed covered in scars . \\n why have n't you healed yet ? '' \\n `` the medic says it 's the type of blade lilith used . \\n the blade was stained in some kind of venom . \\n the venom could be from our world or hers . \\n wherever it 's from , the venom is weakening me , but he 's given me enough blood so that it 's beginning to leave my system . \\n so do not worry , i 'll be out of this bed soon . '' \\n `` i 'm sorry mother . \\n i tried to get to you in time . '' \\n kiowa grabbed my face and pulled me closer . \\n `` it 's okay son . \\n i know you were trying to make it to me . \\n but as the prince , it was your duty to defend this palace . '' \\n `` but as your son , my duty is to defend you . \\n i should have let the guards handle the intruders at the door and came to find you . '' \\n `` you do not really believe that , do you aristaeus . '' \\n i glanced away from her eyes . \\n she was right . \\n if i had it to do all over again , i would have reacted the same way . \\n i just wish i had the strength that i do now . \\n i could have saved a lot more lives then . \\n `` mother , may i ask you a question . '' \\n `` yes . '' \\n `` this ring . \\n this ring you and father gave me when i turned twelve , where did you get it ? '' \\n kiowa sat up some so she could see the moonlight ring on my finger . \\n once her eyes lay upon it , a smile came to her face . \\n `` i remember that ring . \\n your father has one exactly like it . '' \\n `` yes , his is black . \\n is it a family heirloom ? '' \\n `` goodness no . \\n i bought it from a market when i was traveling in arwid . \\n there was a woman selling them . \\n i 'd been to the market many times in arwid , but that was the first time i 'd ever seen her there . \\n she had a strange feel to her . '' \\n `` strange ? \\n what do you mean strange ? '' \\n kiowa chewed her lip as she found herself drifting off to that memory . \\n `` i could n't determine what kind of creature she was . \\n it was like she was blocking me from seeing her true face . \\n the harder i tried to peer at her , the more i was force back . \\n then as if a light switch had been turned off , i forgot all about trying to see what she was . \\n it was like my mind was telling me i was okay with not knowing . \\n that i did n't need to see her face . '' \\n `` is that when you bought the ring ? '' \\n `` yes . \\n she had several moonstone rings . \\n they were all beautiful . \\n i wanted this pink one for myself , when she gave me the one you were wearing . \\n she told me to give it to my son . \\n i remember telling her that i did n't have a child . \\n but she only smiled at me , and said you will soon . '' \\n `` this was before grethen brought me to you . '' \\n i asked . \\n `` actually it was the same day grethen brought you to me . \\n i 'd taken the moonstone ring home and showed it to your father . \\n your father seemed intrigued by it and wanted one for himself . \\n however , with your arrival i could n't go into arwid for another couple of months . \\n when i went back , the woman was nowhere to be found . \\n no one seemed to know who i was talking about . \\n instead of getting a moonstone ring from her , i bought one from another vendor . \\n i never told your father any different . \\n i did n't think it important . \\n maybe i should have said something . '' \\n i shook my head . \\n `` you did right . \\n if it would have been after grethen 's disappearance , then he would have searched to the ends of pearu to find this woman . \\n from what i could tell , this woman does n't seem to want to be found . '' \\n `` i guess you 're right . \\n why is it that you asked about the ring ? '' \\n `` no reason . \\n it 's the last couple of days -- i 've found it to be quite beautiful . '' \\n kiowa smiled as she patted my hand . \\n `` i 'm glad that you love it . \\n just promise me not to tell your father the truth about his ring . \\n he would surely throw it to the side . '' \\n `` no worries , he 's still a bit put out with me . '' \\n `` your father is only pretending aristaeus . \\n he has a face to put on as king , you know this . '' \\n i nodded . \\n `` yes , i know this . '' \\n standing up , i leaned down to place a kiss on her forehead . \\n `` i need to go see dyos and wash up . \\n you get some rest . '' \\n `` i will . '' \\n i turned and walked towards her door when she called my name . \\n `` yes mother . '' \\n `` i know you 're going through a lot . \\n i can sense your troubles . \\n i just want you to know that i still love you , despite what you might become . '' \\n i smiled at my mother and exited out of her room . \\n as i left her quarters , my mind played back on what she 'd told me . \\n this woman seemed to know that she was going to have a son . \\n that same day grethen arrives with me . \\n this could n't have been a coincidence . \\n could this woman be the same woman in my dream , or could she be one of the woman 's allies . \\n this was another thought i needed to keep from my father . \\n while i did n't exactly know how to block my thoughts from him , somehow i 'd managed to hide the vision and the dream from him . \\n i just needed to practice so i could block everything from him . \\n i headed down the halls towards my quarters . \\n for once my quarters were n't heavily guarded . \\n it probably had to do with the distrust they felt towards me , either way i did n't care . \\n i climbed the stairs and headed down the hall to the guest room dyos often vacated whenever he was at the palace . \\n standing outside the door , i rapped against it two times . \\n i could hear some shuffling inside before the door opened revealing dyos . \\n `` it 's you . \\n come in . '' \\n he said stepping to the side . \\n i entered the room as he closed and locked the door . \\n i turned to stare around the room . \\n his bed was untouched and so was his food . \\n `` why have n't you eaten and gotten rest ? \\n you 've been in battle . '' \\n `` i could n't sleep or eat until i knew what the king would do with you . '' \\n `` well i 'm fine , so start eating . '' \\n dyos made his way over to the cart filled with trays of food . \\n he immediately dug in as if he had n't eaten for days . \\n battle did that to you . \\n stuffing his mouth full of meat , dyos asked , `` what did the king say to you ? \\n can you still be king ? '' \\n `` i think i can still be king . \\n he did n't seem to say much on that issue . \\n however , his guards seem to think otherwise . \\n as for what he asked me , he wanted to know the same thing everyone else wants to know , what i am . '' \\n `` i do n't see why it matters . \\n you 're still aristaeus . \\n you just seem to be more . '' \\n `` i do not scare you . '' \\n dyos laughed . \\n `` have n't you learned anything from being my friend all this time ? \\n i fear nothing . \\n you 've just seem to have gained some extra strength , i can still take you if i needed too . '' \\n i laughed . \\n i did n't notice the slight fear i 'd been feeling . \\n i thought dyos would react like everyone else . \\n i thought he would hate me . \\n i should have known better . \\n `` so are you banned from leaving the palace again ? '' \\n `` for now , but for once i am right where i need to be ? '' \\n dyos placed a piece of bread on is plate as he stared at me confused . \\n `` what do you mean ? '' \\n `` do you still have those extra vials hidden in this room ? '' \\n `` yes ? \\n i never used the ones here . '' \\n `` good , we 're going to need them . '' \\n `` i knew there was something off about me . '' \\n dyos said . \\n `` have we created trouble again aristaeus ? '' \\n `` not yet , but we 're about to . '' \\n seventeen dyos and i made plans to meet up later once everyone was asleep . \\n it would be hard to move around the palace without being caught especially with the increase of guardians , but we could handle it . \\n i left dyos to his meal as i retreated to my room . \\n entering my room , i closed my door and headed over to the oval shaped mirror . \\n standing in front of it , i saw myself for the first time . \\n my long black hair seemed darker than possible , the ends with a hint of gold to them . \\n my eyes were no longer the color of black , but now the iridescent color i 'd seen on the gods . \\n the outlines of my eyes were still that of a demon , the shattered lines veiling my colorful eyes . \\n i blinked and watched my eyes turn from green to orange . \\n i closed my eyes and took a step back . \\n this was too much for me . \\n who was i fooling ? \\n i thought i would be able to handle seeing the new changes in me , but i was n't . \\n it only seems to prove more that i was no longer be a part of this world . \\n if i could n't accept myself , how was i expecting the citizens of pearu to accept me as their king ? \\n yelling in frustration , i sent my fist into the mirror . \\n the mirror shattered into pieces dropping down to the floor . \\n there was a slight cut on my hand that seemed to heal just as quickly as it appeared . \\n the door to my room opened as a servant peeped her head in . \\n `` your highness is everything okay . '' \\n she glanced down at the shattered mirror and rushed forward . \\n i raised a hand stopping her in place . \\n `` i am fine . \\n i 'll clean it up . '' \\n the servant nodded and backed hurriedly out of the room . \\n she did n't want to spend more than a second in here if she did n't have to . \\n i walked over to the door and locked it behind her to make sure no one else intruded in on me . \\n walking over to my bed i sat on the edge of it and waited for those in the palace to sleep . \\n the sky finally darkened as the noises in the palace began to cease . \\n opening my door , i peeked my head out into the hallway . \\n the hallway was clear of any guards or servants . \\n i slid through the door and closed it quietly behind me . \\n i walked down the hall to dyos room and opened the door . \\n dyos sat on the edge of the bed , his body tensed . \\n at the sight of me , he sighed in relief . \\n `` i thought no one would ever go to sleep . \\n the palace seems to be a busy place even after the king has called it a night . '' \\n `` never mind that , did you get the servants to bring you up the starfish . '' \\n `` i did . \\n i think they 're starting to suspect something aristaeus . \\n the guards have been walking past my door more than usual , and the servants are giving me weird stares . '' \\n dyos said . \\n `` they do not trust you . '' \\n `` why ? \\n i have n't done anything wrong . '' \\n `` yes , but you are my best friend . \\n they think you 're helping me hide some big secret . '' \\n i said . \\n dyos scoffed as i walked over towards the new cart filled with starfish . \\n i removed the lid on the trays and poked the fish . \\n `` did you find your hidden scroll ? '' \\n `` yeah i did . \\n i ca n't believe i did n't find it last time . \\n i could have saved us a lot of trouble . '' \\n `` no , you would have caused a lot of trouble . \\n it was best you did n't get your memories back right then and there . \\n my father did n't need to know that we were in the giants land . '' \\n `` so you 're just going to let him think lilith erased our memory . '' \\n dyos asked . \\n `` that is the plan . '' \\n i grabbed the starfish and handed it over to dyos . \\n dyos took the starfish out of my hand and began to suck the ocean water from it as i did the same with the other fish in the tray . \\n closing my eyes , bits and pieces of my memory came back to me . \\n opening my eyes i stared across the room and waited for dyos to obtain his full memory . \\n a few seconds later his eyes opened . \\n `` my memory is back and full , yours ? '' \\n `` no . \\n there are some things still missing . '' \\n i now remember teleporting to the field with astraea . \\n i remembered the kiss . \\n i remembered seeing zeus there . \\n i could see astraea being pulled away and i could hear the world `` sacrilege '' replaying over in my head . \\n but that was all i could remember . \\n there were flashes of a conversation i 'd had with zeus , but i could n't remember what we were talking about . \\n i tried to pull something from those pieces . \\n the only thing i could catch was zeus hand 's nearing my face before blackness . \\n `` i ca n't remember much from after i left pearu with astraea . \\n i thought the ocean water from the starfish would have helped . '' \\n `` you 're different now aristaeus . \\n the same things probably do n't work on you anymore . \\n did you take a vial or something while you were away ? \\n did you take something to protect your thoughts from your father ? '' \\n `` no . \\n i did n't have any vials on me . \\n there was a moment where zeus touched me . \\n do you think he could have erased my memory ? '' \\n `` it 's a possibility . '' \\n dyos said . \\n `` you probably asked him to . \\n what else do you remember ? '' \\n `` i remember him saying that i was a sacrilege . '' \\n `` sacrilege ? \\n what 's that ? '' \\n i turned to stare at dyos . \\n i knew i could trust him . \\n i just did n't know if he could handle what i was about to say to him . \\n `` it 's what i am . \\n i 'm half hell demon . \\n i 'm half god . '' \\n dyos stared at me and took a seat on his bed . \\n `` what ... wait ... i do not understand ... huh ? '' \\n sitting in the chair next to his bed , i proceeded to tell him any and everything that i could remember . \\n i told him about my birth , the vision and dream i 'd had , i told him about the woman who 'd given kiowa the moonstone , and i finished it off with bits and pieces of the conversation i could remember from astraea and zeus . \\n `` so you 're half god , and you can hear them ? \\n you can understand everything they say , even if they 're not speaking aloud . '' \\n `` yes . '' \\n `` unbelievable . '' \\n dyos said still staring at me in awe . \\n `` so do you think that 's why lilith has taken a sudden interest in you ? \\n she knows you 're half god and wants you to come over to the dark side . '' \\n `` i do n't think that 's the case . \\n she seemed taken back at my transformation . \\n i think she knew there was something different about me , but i do n't think she was expecting me to be that powerful . \\n in the world she comes from , i doubt she 's ever seen anyone quite like me . \\n i do n't think she 's going to make another appearance any time soon . \\n she 's somewhere hidden , probably trying to regroup . '' \\n `` at least that will give us some time to figure out everything . \\n i remembered that you want me to get the battle plans from my father . \\n i 'll leave in the morning to go see him so i wo n't tip anyone off . \\n i 'll also see what i can find on this grethen character . '' \\n `` thank you . '' \\n `` do you really think your father is going to tell you everything ? '' \\n `` i think he will tell me what he feels i need to know . '' \\n i said . \\n `` if i could have blocked my thoughts on his hidden room , i could have gone back there to search some more . \\n i doubt he 'll leave the room unattended now even for a second . '' \\n `` i agree . \\n so what are you going to do ? '' \\n `` first i will hear what he will have to say , and then i will head to arwid . \\n that is where kiowa saw the woman who gave me this moonlight ring . \\n my father 's ring does n't seem to do anything or even move like mine . \\n i believe the woman who sold kiowa this ring , made it especially for me . \\n i must find her . \\n i believe she will have the answers that i will need . '' \\n `` and if she does n't ? '' \\n `` then i will continue to look for them . \\n i have to find out my purpose . \\n if i 'm an abomination to both sides , why was i even created . \\n someone is using me as a pawn in their little games . \\n i must find out who . \\n i think once i find out all these answers , i will know what to do with lilith . '' \\n `` she 's not going to be easy to get rid of . '' \\n dyos said staring out the window . \\n `` i know . \\n but neither will i. '' `` of all times , i wonder why eris is going about this now . \\n she 's had plenty of opportunities to take out the gods . \\n why wait until you 're almost in reach of the throne and why send a witch to do her dirty work ? '' \\n `` like others in pearu , she does not see me fit as king . \\n the citizens see me as just another royal who just happened to be a good fighter . \\n if something were to happen to me , they would mourn and they would move on . \\n until recently , a fight with me would have been pointless . \\n now , eris has me to consider in her plans . \\n we 've angered lilith and she wo n't let the embarrassment go unpunished . \\n the next time she strikes will be a dangerous one . '' \\n `` well i say let her bring it on . \\n we 'll be ready . \\n the creatures of pearu never shy away from a fight ! '' \\n i laughed at dyos . \\n `` it 's good to have you on my side dear friend . '' \\n `` finally , you 've learned to appreciate me . \\n i knew eventually you would mention how much i mean to you . \\n by the way ? \\n now that you 're half god , do you think there is a chance that you and the lady god can be together ? '' \\n `` her name is astraea , and i do n't know . '' \\n `` what do you mean you do n't know ? '' \\n `` things are difficult right now dyos . \\n i 'm a creature that was n't supposed to be release , and yet somehow i have . \\n the fact that they 've been warned about me throughout their lives might counter in when it comes to being with astraea . \\n for now , the best thing i can do for her , is to stay away . '' \\n `` are you sure this lady is worth it ? '' \\n i stared at dyos . \\n the way he phrased the question brought strange vibes to me . \\n `` what do you mean ? '' \\n `` i 'm not trying to destroy whatever you 're feeling for this woman and i know that i do n't have the best track record when it comes to relationships . \\n but , if you get with this lady , if you guys marry , have you thought about the repercussions it would bring on this world . '' \\n `` my love for my world will not change . '' \\n `` i 'm not asking you that aristaeus . '' \\n `` to be honest dyos , i am not thinking about the repercussions anymore . \\n i know that the two of us getting together will not be good , for both worlds , but my heart is telling me to do this . '' \\n dyos scoffed . \\n `` your heart . \\n you sound mortal . '' \\n `` maybe they have it right . \\n they might be annoying vile creatures , but when it comes to love , true love , they do not worry about the repercussions , and they just go for it . '' \\n `` being in the mortal world is making you spout nonsense . '' \\n `` no , being in the mortal world is making me see things differently . '' \\n i said . \\n `` have you ever thought what we be without them ? \\n we argue and complain that those in the mortal world are the abominations and need to be removed from existence , yet we forget they are the reason we exist . '' \\n `` be that as it may aristaeus that does not mean we should worship them as the gods do . \\n we were created to be evil . \\n do not deny your hell demon blood . \\n no matter what changes you 've gone through , that part still lurks in you . \\n it 's time you start embracing it , because one day you will be king of our land , and your people will need to trust you in order to follow you . '' \\n `` you do not fully trust me , do you dyos ? '' \\n dyos stood up and pointed a finger at me . \\n `` now wait a second . \\n i never said that . '' \\n `` you did n't have to . \\n i can sense it . \\n you 're trying to be the good friend by trying to understand what i 'm going through and i thank you for that . \\n however , i know a part of you is struggling with the new me and whether or not if you can trust me . \\n it 's okay if you feel this way . \\n i would n't expect you to feel any different . \\n in fact , i would be more worried if you did n't feel this way . '' \\n dyos stared at the floor in embarrassment . \\n i did n't mean to bring embarrassment to him , but at the same time i wanted him to know that he could be honest with me . \\n i know there was a part of him that had doubts towards me no matter how big or small . \\n i still had doubts towards myself , and i 'm pretty sure my parents had several doubts about me as well . \\n but i could n't change myself no matter how much a mortal wanted to change skin and become someone else . \\n i was stuck with these new powers , and instead of pouting and whining about it , i would take and harness these powers until i became someone great . \\n `` i 'm sorry . '' \\n dyos said glancing towards me . \\n `` i 'm trying to act like it does n't bother me . \\n i thought i put on a great act for you earlier , but like always , you 've figure me out . '' \\n `` that is why we are friends . \\n we always seem to know when one is having problems . \\n despite , whatever challenges we may face , we still remain friends . \\n right ? '' \\n `` right . '' \\n staring across the room at my friend , i knew that i did n't have anything to truly worry about . \\n once we find out what my purpose of living was , he would begin to feel more at ease . \\n i know i would too . \\n eighteen morning the next day seem to drag as i slowly pulled my way from the entanglement i 'd found myself in within my sheets . \\n today , i would hopefully find out more information on eris from my father . \\n dyos would also be leaving the palace to go home and search for the battle plans and anything he may find on grethen . \\n i promised i would see him off this morning so i needed to get a move on . \\n i showered and dressed making sure to wear the pearu 's colors as a sign of good faith and brown nosing my father . \\n once done , i headed out the room to join dyos who was waiting in the hallway talking to one of the servants . \\n there was an annoyed look on his face as he said something to her before she scurried off . \\n seeing me approached , the look was erased replacing his signature smiled . \\n `` it is about time you 've risen . \\n i feared that you would not wake in time to get me out of here . '' \\n `` i almost did n't . \\n my bed was feeling great this morning . \\n i have n't had a good rest in a while . \\n but , this is more important . \\n sleep can wait . '' \\n i said . \\n `` i saw you speaking with one of the servants , are we caught ? '' \\n `` no . \\n she just happens to be someone i may have spent some time with before she became an employee at the palace . \\n seeing me , she hoped to spark some old flames , but i sent her away . '' \\n `` do you think she will cause trouble for us ? '' \\n dyos chuckled . \\n `` she might be an annoying little gnat , but she knows how to keep quiet when it comes to me . \\n so are we ready to do this or are we going to stand here chit chatting and wait to get caught by one of your father 's guards . '' \\n `` there is no need to worry about my father 's guards . '' \\n reaching into my pocket i pulled out a piece of parchment paper with a purple seal on it . \\n i handed to dyos as he gave me a confused look . \\n `` i thought about this before i went to bed . \\n if we were to go with the original plan , it may look as if you were running away in some type of guilt . \\n the best way to get away unnoticed sometimes is to simply walk right through the front door . '' \\n `` i 'm not following . '' \\n `` this letter is sealed with the king 's stamp . \\n it should be enough to get you through the doors and a carriage back home . \\n they should n't ask to open the letter , but just in case they do , i have written a letter agreeing that you could leave the palace on official duties to the king . '' \\n `` you 're right . '' \\n dyos said sticking the letter in his coat pocket . \\n `` this is a much better plan . \\n i will contact you when i have word . '' \\n i nodded as i watch dyos disappear from my sight . \\n checking my surroundings to make sure no one had noticed our little encounter , i headed down the stairs . \\n the guards and servants greeted me as i entered the main hallway . \\n `` you 're up early my lord . '' \\n the servant from yesterday said bowing to me . \\n i could n't let anyone know that i knew dyos had left the palace so had to put on act . \\n `` yes , i know . \\n dyos and i were going to fence before breakfast . \\n is he up yet ? '' \\n `` i 'm sorry my lord , it seems he has already left the palace this morning . \\n he had a letter from the king so it must have been under his orders . \\n do you want me to send word to him ? '' \\n i waved my hand . \\n `` it is fine . \\n i 'm sure my father had a good reason . \\n is there any word on the queen ? \\n is she doing better ? '' \\n `` i hear from her court ladies that she did not sleep well through the night . \\n his highness spent some time with her before she sent him away . \\n she has been asked to be moved to the guest room in the king 's quarters until she is well . '' \\n i frowned at that . \\n kiowa was not getting any better . \\n the medic has said that eris used some type of venom on the end of her blade . \\n i 'd been scratched with her blade , but i 'd healed thanks to my new powers . \\n yet , kiowa was not healing . \\n `` prepare her a healthy breakfast and grab some flowers from the garden . \\n i think she 'll do better if we can brighten up her room some . \\n also put in a request for the kitchen for me . \\n i would like them to make scorpion stew for breakfast . '' \\n the servant stared at me confused . \\n `` forgive me your highness , but i was told we only make that for the king during the middle of the season . \\n why are you requesting this now ? '' \\n `` do not worry about why i am requesting this , but get it made . \\n call me when breakfast is served . '' \\n i left the servant standing there open mouthed as i walked away from the main hall . \\n i moved a finger signaling one of the guards to follow me . \\n he glanced at his buddies with a suspicious look before following me . \\n i led him to the arena and headed over towards the swords . \\n my weapons were still in the dungeons being held by the guards . \\n i made a mental note to make sure and retrieve them later . \\n i tossed a sword over to the unsuspecting guard . \\n `` i 'm sorry my lord , i do not understand . '' \\n i glanced at the sharpness of the other swords trying to decide my pick . \\n `` you 're new here , i am correct . '' \\n `` yes , your highness . '' \\n `` so i thought . '' \\n i finally picked a sword and turned to face the guard . \\n out the corner of my eye i could see his buddies peeping through the door . \\n they did not trust me to be alone with him . \\n ignoring them , i focused back on the guard . \\n `` i 'm sure you may have heard that i am the one who trains the guards around here . \\n the latest attack from lilith has left our palace vulnerable . \\n we lost some good friends due to surprise and betrayal . \\n i will not let that happen in my home again . \\n on guard ! '' \\n the guard raised the sword nervously to his face as i stared at the way he held it . \\n i sighed . \\n this was going to be a long morning . \\n the guard and i battled , or more so i chased him around the room as he ran dodging my hits . \\n he finally realized i would not let up until he defended himself , so he turned to fight me . \\n i was showing him how to move his feet when locked in with a minotaur when the servant entered the room . \\n `` your highness breakfast is ready . '' \\n `` is the king joining ? '' \\n i asked . \\n `` yes your highness , he will be joining you for breakfast . '' \\n i nodded . \\n `` thank you . '' \\n the servant left as i turned to face the guard . \\n `` we shall pick this up another day . \\n to gain more practice , try with some of your spying buddies over there and let them know they will be next . '' \\n `` yes , your highness . '' \\n he bowed down to me as i accepted it . \\n i passed him my sword so he could return it to its proper place . \\n i headed towards the dining hall to have breakfast with my father . \\n entering the room , i noticed the cold lonely feeling . \\n the curtains were closed on the king 's orders keeping us enclosed in darkness with only the help of candlelight helping us to see . \\n habit had me stopping down at the end of kiowa 's side of the table . \\n reaching out a hand , i touched the top of her chair and sighed . \\n i needed her to get better . \\n like a mortal child , i never wanted to think about my parents leaving this world even though it was something bound to happen . \\n `` are you going to stand there like a fool or are you going to join me for breakfast ? '' \\n my father voice came from the other side of the room . \\n i opened my eyes to see him waiting for a servant to pull out his chair before sitting . \\n i made my way down towards his end of the table as his eyes followed me . \\n they landed on the purple blazer as i watched a sign of approval flash through his eyes . \\n his eyes did not hold the faintness to them from the other day . \\n today the color of purple was sharp . \\n i bowed to him . \\n `` your highness . '' \\n i pulled out the chair beside him and sat down in it . \\n `` where is dyos ? '' \\n i glanced out the corner of my eye to make sure there were no servants around before answering . \\n `` the servants told me he returned home this morning . \\n he had some prior engagements he promised his mother he would do today . \\n he says he will return once he is done and sent his regards by them . '' \\n a servant entered the room holding a silver pitcher making her way towards us . \\n my father lifted his glass for him to fill his cup as he scoffed at my comment . \\n `` if adeline has given him duties , he will not return for a couple more days . \\n if he calls , tell him it is fine . \\n i know how demanding his mother can be . '' \\n the servants came in and out the room filling the table with breakfast . \\n as they placed a bowl of scorpion stew in front of my father , his eyes shot to the servant ready to bellow at him . \\n `` father before you set your teeth into his neck . \\n i feel i should warn you that i was the one who requested this meal for breakfast . '' \\n my father eyes flew to me . \\n sudden understanding came to his eyes as he sat back fully in his chair . \\n his fingers entwined as a hint of a smile hung around his lips . \\n `` so is this how you get information from your rats aristaeus ? \\n if so , i have to say i am not too impressed with your methods . '' \\n `` trust me father , i have other ways of getting information . '' \\n he grinned , his sharp teeth resembling a carnivore . \\n `` let us eat first before we have our talk . '' \\n the two of us dug into our breakfast , the hot broth of the scorpion stew soothing my throat . \\n while i attacked my meal like a starving man , my father ate his as if he was full and could not take another bite . \\n realizing my eyes were on his , he stared over at me with a gleam in his eyes . \\n i knew he was eating slowly on purpose . \\n despite this being his favorite meal , he had no problems torturing me when it came to releasing information . \\n i finished my bowl before he did and waited for him . \\n he finally finished , picking up a cloth to dash against his lips . \\n it 's strange , even though we were n't mortal , we had mortal tendencies . \\n from the way we lived to the way we talked . \\n it was all similar . \\n my father raised a hand to the servants to clear the dinner table . \\n `` do not return the room once the dishes have been taken away . \\n the prince and i will be having a meeting . \\n alert me to any changes to the queen . '' \\n `` yes , your highness . '' \\n the servants quickly cleared the table and then closed the doors leaving my father and i in silence . \\n `` aristaeus , what do you plan to do with this information ? '' \\n `` i 'm not planning anything with it . \\n i 'm just trying to figure out all that is going on . '' \\n my father glanced at me his eyes filled with distrust . \\n it was all well , i 'm sure my eyes will hold them by the end of his conversation . \\n i did not plan on him telling me the full truth . \\n i hope he would however , but hope is a thing with wings . \\n `` i could only give you a little information for it is all i have . '' \\n `` start with when you began to suspect grethen . '' \\n `` i 've always suspected grethen . \\n i suspect anyone from eris to your mother . \\n it is in our nature not to hold trust in others . \\n it is when i began to realize that something was wrong with you . \\n from an early age , you had a gentleness around you that was useless in pearu . \\n as you know , grethen had brought you to us two nights after the gods had sealed the gates . '' \\n `` i did n't know that it was two nights after that . \\n i just thought he brought me a night . '' \\n my father shook his head . \\n `` no . \\n it was the first sign that something was n't right . \\n grethen was always a quiet creature . \\n during the meetings i had with the courant , he would always be in the back sitting in his silence . \\n he 'd speak every now and then when he disagreed with a rule . \\n other than that he was quiet . \\n he never stayed behind to converse with me like the others did . \\n once our work was done , he 'd leave . \\n the fact that he was the one to bring a child to us instead of one of the others was strange . \\n i told him this that night . '' \\n `` what did he say ? '' \\n `` he simply said he did not like the palace to be in distress . \\n it disturbed the peace . '' \\n `` okay , what 's wrong with that . '' \\n i said . \\n i too found it disturbing and uncomfortable whenever my father was angry about something . \\n it was the like the palace could feel it . \\n it is the same now that kiowa is sick . \\n it is as if the palace feels as we feel . \\n `` are you not listening to me aristaeus ? \\n did you not hear me when i said grethen never spent more than the time needed in this palace ? \\n for someone who only comes every blue moon , he should not care how the palace feels to him . \\n he did not have to live here . \\n grethen never respected the palace or my authority . \\n he never addressed me as his king or kiowa as his queen . \\n he always gave off the feel as if he was just visiting . \\n so why care about the emotions of royalty he did not respect ? '' \\n `` maybe he was just being kind . '' \\n my father pointed at me as if i 'd just struck gold . \\n `` now you 're getting somewhere aristaeus . '' \\n i stared at my father as what he was saying started to come together . \\n members of the courant were not kind creatures . \\n not even that , creatures of pearu were not kind creatures . \\n grethen character was not like one of the courant . \\n the members of the courant would not bring my father a child . \\n not because they did not care for their king , it was simply because it would mean there would be someone else to take the throne after my father is gone . \\n it would be another creature in their way for the seat of the king . \\n if anything they would persuade my father to forget having a child . \\n grethen however , someone who never seemed to care about the happenings of the king , brought him a child . \\n not just any child , but a son . \\n a son who will automatically be given the seat as king . \\n and he 'd just happen to find a child two nights after one of the biggest events in pearu . \\n `` you wear the same look that i 'd worn when i realized this . '' \\n my father said . \\n he sipped from his glass and placed it back down . \\n `` i knew your mother was at the door listening , so i could not question him the way i could . \\n i could sense her excitement from the other side of the door and i knew she 'd seen you . \\n she likes to pretend she had no clue , but i knew she did . '' \\n `` so you let grethen go . '' \\n `` i let him go , though i think he knew that i was on to him . \\n i knew if i sent guards to spy on him , he would flee immediately . \\n so , i hired citizens in pearu instead . \\n they did n't seem to mind earning extra money to spy on a member of the elite . \\n they found information that grethen was consorting with a woman . \\n i would n't have found it so strange if they had n't mentioned how uneasy the woman made them and the fact that she did not seem to be a creature from here . \\n receiving that information , i gathered the guards and went to bring grethen in for questioning . \\n however , he somehow gotten word that i was coming for him and disappeared . '' \\n `` did he disappear like eris ? '' \\n `` indeed he did . '' \\n `` do you think the woman was eris ? '' \\n i asked . \\n i knew the woman could n't have been eris , but i wanted to know if my father suspected the same person i did . \\n he seemed to prove that he did as his eyes darted to me . \\n in habit he entwined his fingers . \\n `` do you think the citizens would not recognize their dethrone queen aristaeus ? \\n if anything they would have ran in ready to bow and praise her on the destruction she 'd ordered in the mortal world . \\n no , this woman was someone else . \\n someone that eris seems to hate right along with zeus . \\n i believe she is the one who helped him disappear . '' \\n `` father , in your diary it seemed like this woman and zeus were in cahoots together . \\n do you really think that ? '' \\n `` i think the god and this woman know each other . \\n i use to think she was one of eris sisters that she 'd thought she 'd killed . \\n but with the change you have endured , i think this woman is no rakshasa . '' \\n i stared at my father . \\n `` then what is she ? '' \\n `` this creature ... i have no clue what she is . '' \\n i exited the dining hall closing the door behind me . \\n leaning against the door i closed my eyes and tried to recap everything my father had talked about . \\n my father thought this woman was a god . \\n he then went into this tirade about how he believed the gods were planning on attacking pearu , and that this woman was the one in charged to get background on our world . \\n his reasoning was so far off that i wanted to slap him across the face and tell him to get some sense . \\n the gods were not planning a surprise attack on us . \\n if they wanted to find information on our world , all they had to do was simply look down here and gather information . \\n plus , where did i fit into their so called plan of surprise attack . \\n did they have some kind of switch on me , so that when the battle started , i would lose it and attack my own people ? \\n i sighed . \\n the gods were just as clueless as my father was . \\n though he 'd given me some information on grethen , it was not what i 'd hoped . \\n my father had nothing . \\n he was just grasping strings . \\n it was up to me to gather the information i would need . \\n `` your highness . '' \\n i turned my attention towards a servant who made her way towards me . \\n it was the one from earlier who 'd been with dyos . \\n she glanced around nervously . \\n reaching in her gown , she removed a scroll . \\n i took the scroll from her hands as she quickly bowed and darted out of sight . \\n unrolling the scroll , ink drawn images came into view . \\n it was the battle plans the general had made for my father for the war against the gods . \\n dyos had come through . \\n there was a torn piece of parchment paper in the middle . \\n i picked it up and read dyos handwriting . \\n it is all that i can deliver to you for now . \\n i will meet you tomorrow morning with more information at the entrance to arwid . \\n calling fire to my hand , i burned the parchment and stared at the scroll again . \\n my father was losing his sanity . \\n it would be up to me to save the world of pearu and stop lilith . \\n it seemed that only i could do it . \\n nineteen today was the day that i would meet dyos in arwid . \\n i 'd spent two days in the palace trying to act as everything was ordinary . \\n my father did n't have much time to keep a watchful eye on me like normal since he spent those two days locked in his study . \\n there were times i wanted to visit him in his study , but i knew he did not fully trust me in there anymore . \\n the times he spent in the study also made me wonder if it was because he was trying to come up with another way to protect the room . \\n i would n't be getting in the room anytime soon to find out . \\n so i spent the majority of my two days with kiowa . \\n the venom was a true mystery to the medic . \\n my father had summoned for every medic in pearu to come to the aide to the queen . \\n yet no one could rid my mother of the powerful venom in her body . \\n the venom would often appear and disappear as if it was playing with her . \\n just as we would think she would heal , the venom would reappear spreading worse than before . \\n it was another reason i was going to arwid . \\n maybe i could find some kind of cure that the medics overlooked . \\n standing outside of her bedroom door , i turned the handle and entered . \\n the curtains were drawn and there was a slight smell of sickness in the air . \\n one of her servants sat next to her bed patted the sweat off her head . \\n that was another thing that bothered me about this venom . \\n her symptoms were like symptoms mortals sometimes got when they were stricken with colds and flus . \\n `` give us a moment . '' \\n the servant nodded and vacated her seat , leaving me alone with my mother . \\n i walked over towards her bed and sat down in the chair beside it . \\n i grabbed the cloth the servant had been using , and dipped it into the water in the bowl on the stand . \\n wringing it out , i dabbed it against her forehead . \\n `` aristaeus ? '' \\n `` shh '' i said to her . \\n `` do n't try to speak . \\n save your energy . '' \\n `` i want water . '' \\n `` okay . '' \\n i put the cloth away and grabbed the glass and pitcher off the stand . \\n i filled it with water and turned to let her drink some . \\n she took deep gulps before lying back on the pillow . \\n `` does the water seem to help ? '' \\n `` yes . \\n it soothes the heat in my throat . \\n aristaeus , i want you to know something . '' \\n i waved my hand . \\n `` do n't ! \\n whatever you 're about to say save it for when you get out of bed . \\n i 'm going to arwid to find you a cure so you wo n't be able to lounge around much longer . '' \\n `` you 're going to arwid , when ? '' \\n `` today . '' \\n kiowa stared at me as if she knew the real reason . \\n `` be careful aristaeus . \\n i do not want you turning into your father with this mission . \\n if you do n't find the answers that you are looking for , i want you to return home and just leave it alone . \\n i 'm happy with who you are despite your changes . \\n you 're still my son , and in time your father will agree with me that it does not matter . '' \\n `` no worries mother . \\n i wo n't turn into father . '' \\n i stayed there for a few more minutes with her until she fell asleep . \\n standing over , i stared down at her frail figure and knew that it was more evident that i find a cure . \\n leaving the room , i told the servants to check on her every few minutes and to keep her pitcher filled with cool water . \\n leaving her quarters , i headed towards the main entrance of the palace . \\n stepping out the doors , i saw the carriage i 'd requested waiting in front of the steps . \\n guards moved back and forth filling it with different items that i 'd requested along for my journey . \\n `` is everything accounted for ? '' \\n `` yes , your highness . \\n are you sure you do not need a guard detail ? '' \\n `` i will be fine . \\n do you have my weapons ? '' \\n `` yes , your highness . '' \\n the guard went to the cart that he 'd brought along to load my bags . \\n he removed my demos and jugest and handed the items to me . \\n i wrapped the jugest around my shoulder and the demos around my left shoulder . \\n `` i shall return soon '' the guard helped me into the carriage and closed the door . \\n the carriage pulled to a start moving away from the front of the palace . \\n the bridge lowered and the carriage moved across it rocking against the dents and stumbles on the bridge . \\n glancing out the window , we 'd crossed the bridge as it lifted into the air erasing the palace out of view . \\n sitting back in the carriage , i removed one of the blue journals i 'd requested from the brown bag . \\n opening the book , there was a pen inside . \\n like my father , this book would be used to document my journey and my findings . \\n unlatching the pen , i began to fill the pages , becoming lost in my memories . \\n the journey to arwid was a long one . \\n i 'd stopped writing in my journal to take a lunch break . \\n i enjoyed the servant 's different dishes of prime meats they 'd sent me . \\n now that i was full , sleep was starting to creep up on me . \\n i reached up to close the curtains to the windows . \\n stretching out on the seat , i closed my eyes and waited to arrive in arwid . \\n `` he sure is pretty is n't he ? '' \\n my eyes opened as i gripped my demos . \\n sitting up quickly , i turned to face the intruder . \\n dyos grinned peeping through my window , the blade facing him not bothering him at all . \\n `` dyos , what are you doing ? '' \\n `` rise and shine young prince . \\n you 're in arwid . '' \\n i placed my demos back in my sheath as dyos opened the door to the carriage . \\n i stepped out and immediately smell the scent of barbecuing meat . \\n the land of arwid was known for its savageness despite the new rules brought by the king . \\n the citizens in arwid preferred to keep to the old way of the late queen despite their dislike of her . \\n they enjoyed barbecuing outside and sharing the meat with their neighbors . \\n they enjoyed bartering for goods in the day and having wild parties at night . \\n it was a land for many runaways and wild creatures . \\n it was one of dyos favorite places . \\n at the sight of me stepping out of the carriage , a few passersby 's shot me confused glances . \\n i was n't dressed in the king 's colors and i was n't riding in the normal carriage of kingdom . \\n my carriage was n't poor , but it was n't rich either . \\n i guess their confused glances were because they 'd never seen me in this land , while dyos was a known customer . \\n dyos led me away from the carriage as some creatures came over to unload the carriage . \\n i almost withdrew my demos again , but dyos assured me they would take my bags up to room he 'd got for me . \\n grabbing my arm , he led me away from the carriage and down the dirt road . \\n `` when did you get here ? '' \\n i asked . \\n `` i came as soon as i sent the scroll . \\n i could n't chance my father thinking i 'd taken it so i escaped here . \\n i 've got an alibi that i 've been here for the past week . \\n my mother agreed to cover for me just as long as i bring back trinkets . '' \\n we passed by different booths as creatures called us to come and try their goods . \\n the booths carried things from books , food , ribbons , and other things that creatures of pearu would have used for . \\n dyos stopped at one of the tables and picked up an orange . \\n he tossed the attendant a dragon scale and bit into the orange , peel and all . \\n `` so , where do we start boss ? '' \\n `` first we need to find the place where moonstone rings were sold . \\n if we go to the spot , we may see the woman , and if not we can ask the people around if they 'd remember her . '' \\n `` do you think they would remember someone from that far ago ? '' \\n `` i know it 's a long shot , but it is the only chance that we 've got . '' \\n i said . \\n we moved through the crowd , dyos stopping every minute to check out the selection . \\n i would have gotten annoyed but dyos assured me it was necessary . \\n if we just marched through the lands , the citizens would get suspicious and turn on us . \\n the citizens in arwid did not like spies no matter if they were of the king 's palace . \\n so keeping with his rules , i browsed the booths and picked up a bracelet for kiowa and a couple of books for her . \\n i also found some for myself to read , that is if i ever got the chance to have peace again . \\n we finally made it to the part of the land where kiowa had stated the woman had settled her booth . \\n however , it was clear that this woman was no longer here . \\n in the place where her booth was once located , a bread booth was in its place . \\n an orc stood behind the booth slicing a loaf of bread with a sharp knife . \\n at the sight of us approaching him , he took in our clothing and smiled . \\n the only thought that was going through his mind was that we had money . \\n he was the right guy to question . \\n `` welcome to aster 's bread shop . \\n we have a variety of breads in today . \\n would you like to try a piece of unicorn loaf , or how about a turtle loaf ? \\n `` yes , i 'll take a loaf of each . '' \\n dyos said leaning on the counter smiling . \\n the orc grinned and begin to fill a bag full of the bread dyos requested . \\n `` you picked a good one you did . \\n the unicorn loaves are selling out a lot today . \\n the turtle loaf not so much . \\n creatures just do n't appreciate the good taste of turtle loaf anymore . '' \\n `` well i can never turn down turtle loaves , especially with a side of kampe stew . '' \\n the orc clapped in agreement . \\n dyos was succeeding in gaining the trust of the orc by having the same likes as he did . \\n `` how long have you been in arwid selling this bread ? '' \\n i asked . \\n the orc glanced at me uncertain , but then he remembered i was with dyos . \\n `` i 've been here for only a couple of months . \\n i use to own a bakery in mayur , but with the recent attacks , i decided to move on to a safer place . '' \\n `` you really should move to the city of pearu . '' \\n i said trying my hand at one of dyos smiles . \\n `` you would make a killing in dragon scales if you sell this in the city . \\n the elite love to eat bread . \\n i do n't think they have unicorn bread there . '' \\n `` really ? '' \\n the orc said in excitement . \\n `` really . \\n i know a few people in the city . \\n i could put in a good word for you . \\n maybe even get you a place where you can live above your business . '' \\n dyos added . \\n `` you should take him up on his offer . \\n he got me a real good place to open up a bar . \\n my business is doing really well . '' \\n the orc stared at us . \\n there was a part of him that did not full believe us . \\n we were hell demons , but we talked as if we 'd lived somewhere else besides the main city of pearu . \\n if it was n't for a fellow barter walking by speaking to dyos , i think the orc would have ratted us out to the rest of the barters . \\n `` if you can put in a word for me that would be excellent . '' \\n the orc said deciding he could trust us . \\n `` i do n't know how to repay you . '' \\n `` you could give us some information . '' \\n dyos said . \\n `` what kind of information ? '' \\n `` have you seen a woman around here that sells moonstone rings ? \\n my mother bought one for me when i was young , and i would like to return the favor by purchasing one for her as a gift . '' \\n `` i do n't know anything about a woman selling moonstone rings , but there 's a guy around here that sells them . '' \\n `` a guy ? '' \\n i asked . \\n the orc nodded . \\n `` he 's a demon like you . \\n he sells moonstone rings , but he only gives certain creatures specific types of rings . \\n some say they are filled with power . '' \\n dyos and i glanced over at each other . \\n was it a coincidence that a demon was selling moonstone rings that housed powers like mine ? \\n no , it could n't be . \\n `` where is he ? '' \\n i demanded . \\n `` over there '' the orc pointed . \\n we followed his hand to a demon across the road . \\n he sat behind a booth that was covered in books . \\n `` hey grethen ! '' \\n at the sound of that name a chill went through me . \\n the demon glanced up from the book he was reading . \\n at the sight of us , he jumped up and took off running knocking creatures to the side . \\n dyos and i chased after him as the orc shouted at us `` hey what about the bread ? '' \\n twenty screams erupted around us as we raced through the large marketplace . \\n barters hurried out of our way holding their goods , all the while cursing our entire family name . \\n grethen ran in front of us , not once looking back as he led us away from the marketplace and deeper into arwid . \\n i had no idea where he was leading us , but i had a feeling that if we were to turn around and head back , the barters would not welcome us as kindly as they did before . \\n i was pretty sure that by the time we arrived back , all our bags and cases will be on the streets empty of their contents . \\n hopefully dyos , will have a plan how to help us there . \\n grethen ran into the forest as dyos slid to a stop . \\n `` why are you stopping ? '' \\n `` aristaeus , i think this guy is leading us into a trap . \\n there is nothing out here besides forest lands . '' \\n `` maybe that is why no one can find him . \\n he 's probably built a home out here out of reach of the barters and citizens of arwid . '' \\n `` i do n't know aristaeus . '' \\n i ignored him . \\n grethen was getting away while we were standing here debating . \\n `` fine , you stay here , i 'm going to find him . '' \\n i left dyos standing there and raced into the forest . \\n there was silence behind me for a few minutes before i heard the sound of dyos boots following me . \\n i slowed a bit to allow him to catch up . \\n `` i just said it was stupid . \\n you did n't have to leave me . '' \\n i shushed him as i looked around the forest . \\n grethen was nowhere in sight . \\n i wanted to yell at dyos and tell him that this was all his fault , but i did n't . \\n while we might have stopped for a few seconds , it was n't enough time for grethen to get that far away . \\n removing my demos , i glanced around the forest area . \\n he had to be somewhere close . \\n he did n't just disappear into thin air like that . \\n following my lead , dyos removed his sword . \\n together we crept through the forest taking turns sweeping the ground and the trees . \\n the further we moved into the forest , the colder it got . \\n it was strange since the temperature of pearu rarely had a chill . \\n every now and then , there would be a breeze with the wind , but never nothing of this icy temperature . \\n `` there 's a spell here . '' \\n just as the words left my mouth , grethen flew down from the trees . \\n he landed in front of dyos , and immediately began to fight dyos . \\n dyos held his own against the demon as he tried to control the fight with his footwork . \\n however , grethen appeared to not be your typical member of the courant . \\n most members of the courant relied on the guards to defend and protect them . \\n grethen with his excellent swordsmanship and footwork was proving that he did not need anyone to fight his battles for him . \\n i inched forward with my weapon waiting to get an entrance into the fight . \\n unlike mortals , creatures of the damned did not fight all at once . \\n our battles were always fair , one on one combat . \\n it was only when you feared your partner might lose , that you jumped in to relieve them of an approaching death . \\n grethen 's footwork proved to be too much for dyos as he made a near fatal move second guessing where the demon would hit . \\n it was because i had a quick hand , that i saved dyos from what could have been his death . \\n my blade landed in front of grethen 's , as i took one hand and shoved dyos back so he could regroup . \\n the demon did not seem to mind his new opponent as he turned his attention to me . \\n our blades clang together , as our boots danced back and forth in the dirt . \\n the demon realized that my swordsmanship was far better than dyos and the fact it would take more than some fancy footwork to throw me off . \\n pulling a dirty move , grethen called forth fire and shot it at me . \\n the flame flew towards my face as i jumped back to protect myself . \\n i tripped over a tree trunk behind me as i tumbled over . \\n grethen ran towards me ready to pierce his sword in my chest . \\n dyos blocked his sword and tried to knock it out the demon 's hand , only to be sent flying into a tree on the left side of me . \\n with no one to stop him , the demon raised his sword and lunge it towards my chest . \\n my hands shot up and caught the blade in my hands , as i tried to detour its route . \\n the demon stared down at me , his eyes showcasing my death sentence . \\n the blade turned in my hands as my ring gleamed against the shine of the blade . \\n the demon caught sight of my ring , and quickly withdrew his sword , the blade slicing my hand . \\n he took a step back and pointed the sword at me . \\n `` who are you ? '' \\n `` should n't you have asked that , before you started attacking us ? '' \\n dyos moaned from his spot by the tree . \\n `` silence ! '' \\n shouted grethen . \\n his focus was all on me . \\n his eyes roamed over me , taking in my appearance . \\n the orc from earlier had n't taken the time to do the same since his mind was on the amount of dragon scales he would be receiving for his bread . \\n grethen was an alert one however . \\n being on the run had made him cautious . \\n as he stared at me , it did not take him long to realize who i was . \\n `` you are aristaeus , the king 's son . '' \\n `` prince aristaeus ! '' \\n `` silence dyos . '' \\n i said standing up . \\n `` yes , i am aristaeus , prince of pearu . '' \\n grethen nodded and placed his sword in its sheath . \\n he walked over to dyos and helped pulled him up . \\n dyos mumbled something to him that sounded like curses as he made his way over towards me . \\n `` you 're far away from the city young prince . '' \\n `` i 've come on a quest to find a certain creature . \\n a female creature that sells moonstone rings . \\n i figured you could help me . '' \\n grethen laughed . \\n `` so you came all the way to arwid to ask me to help you find a female . \\n how did you know i was here ? '' \\n `` we did n't '' dyos said . \\n `` someone recommended you to us in our search when we got here . \\n it was you who freaked out and ran away as if you 'd done something wrong . '' \\n `` trust me , i have done many things wrong . \\n besides i know how to spot the king 's men even in civilian clothing . '' \\n grethen walked towards the tree he 'd jumped down on us in , and began to climb it . \\n dyos and i shared a glance of curiosity . \\n he came back down the tree holding a brown saddle bag that he slipped over his shoulder . \\n turning in the direction he 'd been running earlier , he walked away from us . \\n it was only when he was a few feet away that he shouted over his shoulder , `` are you two hellions coming ? '' \\n dyos and i followed behind the demon as he led us deeper into the forest . \\n once again , the chill temperature of the forest put us at unease . \\n despite grethen being someone that i needed to talk to , i did not trust him fully . \\n i kept my hand on the hilt of my demos just in case he was leading us into dangerous territory . \\n the dangerous territory turned out to be a small stone cabin in the middle of the woods . \\n the cavern was one of miniature proportion as the branches and grass covered it hiding it from view . \\n grethen walked up towards the cavern and removed the stone door that covered the opening . \\n `` close that back once you 're in . '' \\n dyos stepped through the opening after grethen , as i followed , turning to roll the stone back into place . \\n the room was dark , but we could still see thanks to our sight . \\n grethen gave us even more sight , as he walked over to the hanging lanterns and lit it . \\n one by one the caverns lit up around the room , revealing a nice size home . \\n we stood in what appeared to be the sunroom . \\n the sunroom was filled with one chair and a couch . \\n an oak table sat in the middle covered in throngs of books and scrolls . \\n off to the left was a kitchen , and towards the back were two more rooms that could have been his bathroom and bedroom . \\n grethen gestured over to the seats . \\n `` have a seat . \\n i 'll get you something to drink . '' \\n i walked over to the couch and sat . \\n dyos plopped down beside me and leaned over to me . \\n `` aristaeus , remember we do not know this guy . \\n do not drink anything from him . '' \\n `` that is a very rude thing to say in someone 's home . '' \\n grethen voice rung out from across the room . \\n we turned to face him as he made his way over to us carrying a tray filled with a pitcher and two cups . \\n `` since you 're at the prince 's side , i 'm sure you 've been taught some manners . '' \\n `` of course i have , but those are only reserved for the elite , not backwater leeches . '' \\n `` dyos ! '' \\n i shouted . \\n dyos shouted me a look as to say `` what . '' \\n dyos mouth is what often got us into trouble back in the day . \\n while it used to be funny then , it was n't so much now . \\n i needed information and he was doing his best to be an unruly houseguest . \\n `` never mind your friend . '' \\n grethen said placing two clay mugs in front of us . \\n `` you 'd do better to take notes from him young prince . \\n your friend is right when he says that you ca n't trust everyone , no matter how bad you may need them . \\n his mistake was allowing me to overhear him . \\n in someone else 's home , it could have meant his death . '' \\n grethen walked over to the chair across from the coffee table and plopped down . \\n `` as it is , i find him to be quite funny . '' \\n i did n't know what to say to that and neither did dyos . \\n i stared down into my mug to see a black liquid . \\n the color of the liquid was almost hardly identifiable because of the darkness of the mug . \\n `` what is this ? '' \\n `` seaweed tea . \\n it 's good for your muscles after a battle or fight . \\n not that you will need that aristaeus . \\n i bet you 've healed already . '' \\n grethen said . \\n i turned to look at dyos who shrugged his shoulders . \\n he 'd yet to drink from his cup . \\n putting my trust in the runaway demon across from me , i raised the cup and sipped the liquid . \\n `` aristaeus ! '' \\n dyos shouted . \\n he tried to take the cup from me , but i moved it away . \\n `` it 's okay dyos . \\n it 's bitter , but it 's drinkable . '' \\n grethen laughed as he sipped from his own cup . \\n he took a big gulp before placing the empty mug on the coffee table . \\n `` now , let 's get to the reason you 're here . \\n you claim to be looking for a female selling moonstone rings . '' \\n `` yes i am . \\n the woman sold my mother a moonstone ring a couple years back before i was born . \\n it was this ring actually . '' \\n i rubbed the white moonstone ring as thoughts of kiowa came to me . \\n i could not forget to get the cure before i took my leave . \\n `` the woman who sold the moonstone ring gave her this ring despite the one she wanted . '' \\n `` what 's the problem in that ? '' \\n `` this woman also prophesized that my mother would have a son despite she could not give birth . \\n later that night , a member of my father 's courant , delivered a male baby to her . \\n that member , was you grethen . '' \\n grethen rubbed his face . \\n `` it is true . \\n i delivered you to your parents . '' \\n `` can i ask you for what reason did you have to bring me them ? \\n did you get the order from the woman in the marketplace ? '' \\n `` to answer your last question , yes . \\n i got the order from the woman in the marketplace . \\n to answer your first question , i did it because she requested it . '' \\n `` that 's not a good reason . '' \\n dyos scoffed . \\n `` it is the only reason i can give you . '' \\n `` who is she ? '' \\n i asked . \\n `` the woman in the marketplace . '' \\n `` you already know the answer to that young prince . '' \\n grethen said . \\n `` you 've only come here to confirm it . '' \\n i stared at grethen as he smiled . \\n he was right . \\n i knew who the woman was already . \\n i just needed confirmation that the woman in my vision and the woman in the marketplace were the same one . \\n `` samr . \\n her name is samr . '' \\n i said . \\n as i breathed her name out , i felt a surge of relief go through me . \\n it felt good to finally be able to say her name . \\n `` yes . '' \\n `` who is samr ? '' \\n grethen sat back in his chair as he got comfortable . \\n `` that is a good question young prince . \\n samr is not a creature of this world or of the mortal world . \\n samr is not from the land of the gods , yet she has lived there in the past . \\n she is more powerful than the king of pearu , but not as powerful as zeus . \\n her species is unknown for she possesses the powers of shape shifting . '' \\n `` i do n't understand ? '' \\n i said confused . \\n `` how is her species unknown ? '' \\n `` you would be surprised the types unknown of creatures that exist within our universe . \\n surely you did not think there were only three worlds . '' \\n `` you mean there are more . '' \\n dyos asked . \\n `` why are n't we aware of the other worlds ? '' \\n `` because it is not in our purpose . '' \\n grethen said . \\n he glanced over at me to see how i was taking it all in . \\n `` do you wish for me to continue ? \\n i have n't even gotten to the good parts yet . '' \\n i nodded letting him know that he could continue . \\n my mind was still reeling with the information of there being more worlds and samr being a fallen god , but i pushed it to the side so that i could fully concentrate on grethen 's story . \\n `` samr was not a planned creature . \\n she was an experiment by the goddess artemis . \\n artemis as you know was the goddess of the moon . \\n she prided herself on maidenhood and chastity , but had a temper worse than those of the titans . \\n one day , artemis went to zeus , to ask him if she could create a companion . \\n she 'd been stationed away from her friends and found herself to be quite lonely . \\n however , the goddess had forgotten the rule of creating without the consent from the creator . \\n zeus reminded her of this , leaving the god filled with sadness . \\n leaving the castle , artemis stumbled upon athena , who was enjoying a golden staff that her father had gifted her with . \\n it became clear then how unfair she and her siblings were treated when it came to athena . \\n athena received everything . \\n filled with anger , artemis stole the book of fate , glamouring herself from the sight of the gods . \\n opening the book to the spell that would give her the companion she so desperately hoped for , she stole remnants of the moon and sun from their guardians , using them in her spell . \\n and thus , samr was created . \\n as you must know , zeus was not happy about this . '' \\n `` what did he do ? '' \\n dyos asked engrossed in the story . \\n he was so enraptured that he was unaware of that fact that he 'd drunken from the mug . \\n grethen seemed to notice the same thing as he chuckled . \\n `` what could he do ? \\n samr was already created and it would be cruel of him to eradicate her because of artemis disobedience . \\n so he allowed her to live in their world , as long as she followed the rules . \\n and for a while , it worked . \\n it was only when apollo , artemis twin brother started to take notice in the beautiful samr , that things began to get chaotic . \\n apollo had fallen in love with samr and began to follow her around . \\n samr , however , did not feel the same , and often tried to avoid the sun god . \\n on the day she fell , apollo came to her to confess his feelings . \\n he could n't stand being away from samr , and wanted her to be his wife . \\n when samr denied him , apollo was filled with a heavy rage and hurt . \\n acting on his emotions , he cursed samr , taking away the sun that artemis had stolen from him , branding her to live by the light of only the moon . \\n samr fell from the sky , falling into unconsciousness . \\n artemis , arrived to see what her brother had done and tried to undo the curse , but it was too late . \\n samr had somehow fallen away from the sight of the gods , never to be seen again . '' \\n `` i bet apollo felt bad after he 'd cursed her . '' \\n i said . \\n `` of course . \\n he even went to zeus to plead in his help to find her . \\n the gods searched the worlds for her , but she was nowhere to be found . '' \\n dyos scoffed . \\n `` this is ridiculous . \\n the gods could not find one of their own . '' \\n `` you forgot the gods can glamour themselves dyos . '' \\n i said . \\n `` i 've seen them do it . \\n it 's a small power gifted to them that allows them privacy . \\n if samr lived with them , i 'm sure she learned how to do it as well . '' \\n `` correct you are aristaeus . '' \\n `` so she fell never to be seen again , but somehow you 've met her , and she has created me . \\n how was she saved ? '' \\n i asked . \\n `` who saved her ? '' \\n `` i 'm sure you know the answer to that question as well . \\n our creator saved samr and preserved her powers , locking them within her until there came a time where evil would try to destroy the universe . \\n when that time came , samr was to create three leaders who would fight and save their world from complete annihilation . \\n that time has come . '' \\n `` you mean eris ? \\n she 's the evil that the god warned of ? '' \\n `` but she 's just a rakshasa . '' \\n said dyos . \\n `` eris is more than that rakshasa . \\n do not forget her father was the hindu god of creation . \\n they are higher up than that of the olympian gods like zeus which is why the king of gods has not killed her yet . \\n she is more powerful than him . \\n and now , she has in her possession the cosmic orb . '' \\n grethen said . \\n `` what is the cosmic orb ? '' \\n `` the cosmic orb is the life force that keeps the worlds running . \\n eris 's father was the guardian of the orb . \\n however , as a last final act of disobedience against the creator , he cast a spell creating a plague upon the orb . \\n as the day came for him to be sentenced , the hindu god hid the orb among one of the worlds , hoping one of his daughters would follow in his steps in destroying all the creator held dear . \\n eris has followed in his footsteps . \\n in seeking revenge against her father 's enemies and hers , she went on a search to find the orb . \\n now she has the orb , and has gathered enough souls to unleash the plague . '' \\n `` pearu . '' \\n i breathed out . \\n `` eris plans to destroy pearu first , because it was where she was sentenced to live . \\n add to it her dethroning by zeus and my father as well as the closing of the gates of the mortal world . \\n it makes the perfect place to strike . '' \\n i now understood why eris was now striking war in our land . \\n the attacks that were delivered was just what we assumed , it was all an act . \\n due to my father consorting with the gods and the different attacks in pearu , the citizens had begun to lose faith in the king turning their backs on him , just like they did her . \\n she did not care if the creatures of pearu backed her up for they were already in her mind set as betrayers . \\n but where did lilith play into all of this . \\n `` what about lilith ? \\n why is she here in our world ? '' \\n `` in another world , lilith and eris are close friends . \\n it is the world eris disappeared to after her dethronement . \\n i do n't know all the details of what happened in that world , but it was enough for lilith to pledge her loyalty to eris , and follow her here . '' \\n `` am i the first ruler that samr created ? '' \\n `` yes . '' \\n grethen answered . \\n `` samr knew about the box hidden among the waters of the mortal world not because the gods had feared it , but the creator had told her where to find it . \\n she traveled to earth and retrieved the box . \\n samr studied the soul for days before she finally understood how to control the soul of the sacrilege . \\n in order to control the sacrilege , the soul would need to live in that of a mortal infant . '' \\n i stared at grethen confused . \\n `` what good is the soul in a mortal infant ? \\n would n't it still be the same as it was before ? '' \\n `` unlike before , the soul would be mixed with that of a mortal soul . '' \\n `` but there was n't a mortal soul in the infant . \\n i saw it in my vision . \\n kithara placed the soul in the infant 's body only after it was gone . \\n i watched it leave the infant 's body . '' \\n grethen laughed . \\n `` you only saw part of what happened young prince . \\n yes , the soul of the mortal infant was released from the body so that of the sacrilege could enter , and then it returned . \\n kithara disappeared before you could see it . \\n the minute she teleported , the mortal doctors arrived in the room to revive the infant . \\n the soul was still hovering between worlds . \\n but when it felt the tug towards earth , it returned to its body , meshing with the sacrilege soul calming it . \\n it is why you feel sympathy for the mortals . '' \\n `` i thought it was just because i was a reaper . '' \\n `` yes , reapers feel sympathy for having to endure the mortal world , but the second their contract ends , so does their feelings . \\n they return to creatures of the damned and their harboring hate for the mortals . '' \\n `` so when does this plague get released ? '' \\n dyos asked . \\n `` how long do we have to prepare ? \\n i mean how we are supposed to fight something we have no clue about . '' \\n grethen stood and walked over to a rusted calendar on his wall . \\n his finger ran down the page stopping on a date . \\n `` the plague will arrive in four days . \\n in four days you will have all the answers you will need . '' \\n `` there is a battle coming up . '' \\n i said quietly . \\n `` my father plans to go to war against the gods . '' \\n grethen turned to face us tucking his hands behind his back . \\n `` it was bound to happen aristaeus . \\n do not worry yourself over such things . \\n the gods know how to handle themselves . '' \\n i opened my mouth to say something else to grethen when i heard the voice again . \\n aristaeus . \\n i glanced around the room expecting to see her , but it was only the three of us . \\n i glanced over at grethen who stared at me with a smile on my face . \\n his eyes told me that he knew what was going on . \\n the voice called for me again and this time i found myself standing . \\n `` aristaeus , are you okay ? '' \\n dyos asked with concern . \\n he looked from me to grethen , alarm growing on his face . \\n `` it was the tea , was n't it ? '' \\n i shook my head . \\n `` no , it 's her . \\n i can hear her again . '' \\n `` who ? \\n samr ? '' \\n `` stay here . '' \\n i said walking past him and heading towards the stone that was covering the entrance . \\n dyos jumped up to follow me , but grethen placed a hand on his shoulder stopping him . \\n the two exchanged words as i moved the stone from the door . \\n stepping through the opening , i took a few steps before i saw her . \\n there she was in front of me , standing in the midst of the trees looking the same as she did in my dream . \\n only now i could see her face . \\n raising a hand out to me she said , `` hello aristaeus . '' \\n twenty-one i never found myself being shaken by another female until i met astraea . \\n now as i stand across from samr , i could n't stop my mouth from opening and closing . \\n she was extremely beautiful , and had an aura about her that seemed to bring a sense of calm . \\n butterflies that i had n't noticed when we first arrived , floated around her , one even landed on her shoulder . \\n her black hair fell straight down her back as it blew softly . \\n there was n't any wind blowing , and yet her hair was moving . \\n she had an oval shaped face and cat shaped eyes with pupils the color of forest green . \\n around her neck she wore a necklace that was the shape of a sun but the color was white . \\n it was the same whiteness that i 'd often seen in my moonstone ring . \\n on the sides of it were two blue crescent moons . \\n my eyes left her neck and traveled to her outstretched hand . \\n i was afraid to touch her . \\n not because i thought she would harm me , but that i would taint her skin . \\n she seemed to hear my thoughts as she laughed . \\n birds nearby chirped at the sound . \\n `` you do not have to touch my hand if you do not wish to . '' \\n i gave a crooked smile as i moved around . \\n i darted a glance back at the cabin , but the stone was back in place leaving the two of us alone in silence . \\n i glanced back at samr . \\n `` i 've been waiting to meet with you . '' \\n `` i know . \\n i 've been waiting to meet you as well . \\n i would have shown myself to you earlier , but you were not ready . '' \\n `` and i am now ? '' \\n `` yes , i think you are . '' \\n samr turned and headed towards a boulder sitting on the side of the cabin . \\n she climbed upon it and sat down . \\n her head leaned back as she stared at the sky . \\n `` i 've always loved the color that was chosen for your world . \\n it 's an interesting color . \\n do you know what it means ? '' \\n i shook my head no . \\n `` the color purple is of good judgment . \\n it 's supposed to give you a peace of mind . \\n it symbolizes royalty , magic , power , and mystery . '' \\n `` the creator should have just painted our sky black . \\n it seems more fitting than purple . '' \\n `` i think it fits . '' \\n `` you do . '' \\n i asked . \\n i moved closer to her taking slow precaution steps . \\n `` you do n't think that black would be a good color for creatures of the damned . '' \\n `` if you were judging from a mortal perspective than yes . \\n mortals believe your world to be filled with demons that do nothing but torture souls every day without stopping . \\n they do not know that you have minds and ambitions of your own . \\n your world lives by that of the king , who despite his reactions , has good judgment when it comes to his world and creating a flowing civilization . \\n your world possesses magic and power that may be dark but sometimes can also be beautiful . \\n because the mortals do not know this , your world remains a mystery . \\n it is why the creator chose this color for your world . \\n black would have been too harsh and untrue . '' \\n `` i guess i never seen it that way . '' \\n `` creatures of their world never seem to do . \\n do you think the mortals see anything beyond their blue sky ? \\n they just see it as pretty . '' \\n samr laughed . \\n `` i find them to be a cute kind . \\n they are lost , but they are still cute , and they are special to me . '' \\n i had a feeling that she was quizzing me on my feelings for mortals to see if i was up for the role of being the leader . \\n if i said the wrong thing , she would probably turn me into dust and choose someone else to take my place . \\n `` i would not do that to you aristaeus . \\n for one , your soul is the only soul of a sacrilege . \\n we do not have the time to wait for another one to be created and thrust into another infant child . \\n second , i do not expect you to have the same feelings that i do for the mortals . \\n your soul is mixed with your demon side , so there will always be a conflict of emotions to you when it comes to mortals . '' \\n i picked up a rock and played with it in my hand . \\n `` grethen told me that you created me to help stop the plague eris plans to have her followers release in pearu . \\n i do n't want to sound ungrateful . \\n i am happy you chose me . \\n i just do n't understand what i am to do . '' \\n `` i want nothing more than for you to lead your people aristaeus . \\n when the plague reaches your world , there will be bloodshed and betrayal . \\n your people will become lost . \\n you must not give up on them , even if they turn their backs against you . '' \\n `` will many die ? '' \\n samr answered with hesitation . \\n `` yes . \\n there are always casualties in war . '' \\n i nodded and tossed the rock towards the woods . \\n in four days my world will become a battle ground . \\n i had no idea what this plague would bring , but i know it would cause casualties . \\n it was up to me to stop them before they completely destroyed pearu . \\n i just hope i could convince my father of this much . \\n he was a man that needed evidence before he acted . \\n he did n't get to where he was by trusting heresy . \\n `` grethen said that eris was stronger than zeus which was why he could n't kill her . \\n is she stronger than you as well ? '' \\n `` she once was , but not anymore . '' \\n samr said . \\n `` so why ca n't you take care of things ? \\n why ca n't you stop her from destroying our world completely ? '' \\n `` it is not my mission aristaeus . \\n every creature in this universe has a purpose . \\n we lived to serve our creator and protect the gift that he has bestowed upon us . \\n no matter what you 've come to believe , this is not a free life . \\n we all have our duties in keeping the universe safe from danger . '' \\n `` will the other two leaders have to face a mission like mine ? '' \\n samr stared off into the trees as a sad smile came to her lips . \\n `` yes , and they will be far worse than yours . \\n they will have to go through their own changes to reach a level where they can be confident in saving their people and their world . \\n you will reach that level soon . '' \\n `` will we ever meet ? \\n the other leaders and i ? '' \\n `` that for now is uncertain . \\n i can only see your future at the moment . \\n since they have not been created yet , i can not see them . '' \\n i walked over to the boulder to stand beside her . \\n i was n't afraid to be near her anymore . \\n the aura that she carried around with her had done its job in calming me fully . \\n i pulled up on the boulder beside her . \\n together we both stared up at the purple sky . \\n a flock of white birds flew overhead . \\n from my seat i could see the broken leg of one of the birds as it wobbled in the air . \\n samr raised a finger towards the sky . \\n the top of her finger began to shine as she pointed it at the wobbling bird . \\n the bird dropped down as it broken leg began to stretch out . \\n completely fixed , the bird gave a cheerful chirp and flew happily to catch up with his flock . \\n he was no longer flying behind them , but with them . \\n `` how did you do that ? '' \\n i asked in awe . \\n `` just one of my many gifts . '' \\n remembering the story grethen told about her , i felt myself filling with questions i wanted to ask her . \\n she seemed to sense this because she said . \\n `` you may ask me anything aristaeus . '' \\n `` i do n't want to pry into your life . '' \\n `` i do not have secrets . \\n i will tell you what you need to know . '' \\n `` grethen said that apollo cursed you . \\n were you angry with him ? '' \\n i asked . \\n samr raised a hand to catch a fallen leaf . \\n grasping it in her hand , she said . \\n `` no , i was n't angry . \\n i was more so hurt . \\n i guess i should have figured that he would n't act rashly . \\n artemis was the one known for her temper , but apollo could have a mean one too . \\n i knew how he felt about me , and yet i could not return those feelings to him . \\n i never meant to embarrass him . \\n i never wanted to leave their world . \\n i loved it . '' \\n `` but now you have your own world . \\n i saw it in my dream , it 's beautiful . '' \\n `` thank you aristaeus , that really mean a lot to me . \\n the sky was beginning to take on a tint of darkness and i knew my father would be calling it night soon . \\n samr did n't seem to mind this as she stretched out along the boulder . \\n i tried to stretch my ears to hear inside of the cabin . \\n i needed to make sure dyos was okay alone with grethen . \\n `` do not worry about grethen . '' \\n samr laughed . \\n `` he wo n't harm your friend . \\n although i 'm not sure if he 'll stay true to his calm if your friend continues to go through his things . '' \\n i frowned at that . \\n dyos did n't go through someone 's things unless he was comfortable with them . \\n i wondered what the demon had said to gain dyos trust so soon . \\n `` grethen seems to know a lot about you . '' \\n `` he is a good friend . \\n i 've known him since his days as a reaper . \\n like you , he gained feelings towards the mortals . \\n his feelings became so strong , that he begged for the creator not to return him to the world of pearu . \\n he could not tolerate working for eris any longer and knew she would not show mercy towards his sudden compassion . \\n grethen wanted to live in a world of peace . \\n the creator sent him to me , and i blessed him with that life . \\n he has been with me since then . '' \\n `` did kithara want peace like grethen too ? '' \\n i asked . \\n `` is that how you saved her ? '' \\n `` kithara wanted revenge instead of peace . \\n it was because her feeling of sadness was so strong , that i was pulled towards her . \\n i saved her and showed her that she could live with me in peace , but kithara still hung on to that revenge . \\n it was the true reason why she decided to help me in my mission . \\n she had loyalty and she cared for me , but her thirst for revenge overrode that . \\n but , on the last night of her life , she decided not to act on that revenge , and instead greeted death with a smile on her face . \\n i felt a happiness that she 'd found peace and knew that the creator would have plans for her in whatever plain she ended up in . '' \\n a tear rolled from samr 's eye as i raised a hand to catch it . \\n the crystal dropped landed on finger as it melted into my skin . \\n feeling as if i just betrayed astraea , i moved my hand away and tucked it under me . \\n i hoped that these were one of the times that zeus kept her locked away . \\n i could n't imagine how she would feel if she 'd saw me comforting samr , no matter how innocent it was . \\n `` you love her . '' \\n `` huh . '' \\n i said turning to samr . \\n `` astraea . \\n you love her . \\n it 's okay to love her samr . '' \\n `` i want to think that . \\n but when i think of my world and the responsibilities i have , the love i have for her does n't seem to be worth it . \\n i do n't want to betray my world and lead them to extinction because of my emotions . '' \\n `` emotions are what have driven some of the greatest leaders aristaeus . \\n do not give up on your love for her just because you are afraid of what your father thinks . '' \\n i sighed . \\n samr was right . \\n she 'd seen right through me . \\n i knew that the only person opinion that mattered to me when it came to astraea was my father . \\n for my whole life i 'd been living to please him . \\n everything i did , it never seemed to please him . \\n there were times i felt that i should give up and just be happy , but i knew i would n't be happy until i could have my father 's approval . '' \\n samr jumped down from the boulder and turned to face me . \\n `` i should be going . \\n i ca n't be away from my world for too long . \\n i do n't want to worry the ones i left behind . '' \\n `` you have creatures in your world . '' \\n samr laughed . \\n `` of course i do . \\n you honestly did n't think that was alone in my world . '' \\n i laughed and scratched my head . \\n staring at her , i realized that i was n't ready for her to leave . \\n i still had so many questions that i wanted to ask her . \\n we 'd just met and the time had already gone by . \\n `` this will not be the last time that we meet . \\n just keep in mind that i will always be with you . \\n all you have to do is think of me , and i will show myself to you . '' \\n `` okay . '' \\n samr walked off towards the direction she 'd been standing in earlier . \\n she came to a stop as she turned around to face me . \\n `` aristaeus , i must ask that you not let anyone know that i was here . \\n it could cause complications . '' \\n `` i wo n't tell anyone . '' \\n i assured her . \\n i did n't think that anyone would believe me anyhow . \\n no one in pearu knew of samr besides my father , eris , and now dyos . \\n i knew dyos would n't let anything about her slip . \\n she would have to remain a secret . \\n `` samr , why does eris want to kill you ? \\n how does she know you exist ? '' \\n samr gave a sad smiled . \\n `` because ... i am her sister . '' \\n i stared in shock as i tried to make sense of what she said . \\n my father was right . \\n `` her sister ? \\n i thought ... i thought artemis created you . '' \\n `` she did . \\n the creator accepted my plea for forgiveness and i was given a chance to be reborn as a god . '' \\n `` how did eris find this out ? '' \\n `` i made the fatal mistake of entering pearu . \\n i wanted to see her for myself . \\n i guess it was my way of checking up on her . \\n at that time , i had not been given any mission . \\n she was in a carriage arriving in the countryside . \\n as if a light had been turned on , she glanced through the window of the carriage and saw me hiding behind a tree . \\n shock went through her and then hatred . \\n it was clear the creator had forgiven me for my sins . \\n it was then she decided she would kill me again . \\n only i disappeared before she could . \\n she has n't seen me since , but she knows that i 'm still out there . \\n you 're proof of that . '' \\n `` samr , are we going to win . '' \\n samr glanced down at the ground and back at me . \\n turning around she walked off into the forest and disappeared . \\n the calmness that had accompanied her was now gone as i was left alone with the chill and silence . \\n `` i still ca n't believe you left me behind like that . \\n did you not forget you were in foreign land and we have a bunch of angry barters after us ? '' \\n dyos fussed . \\n grethen had decided to allow us to stay the night at his cabin . \\n he would go to the marketplace in the morning in hopes to smooth things over for us with the barters . \\n his cabin was a small place , but it would do . \\n it was no bigger than my room at belham . \\n the thought of belham made me think of os ' mar. . \\n i still had no clue what the gods had done with him . \\n `` aristaeus , are you even listening to me ? '' \\n i glanced up from the book i was reading . \\n grethen had a ton of good novels in his collection . \\n i was surprised to find novels of the supernatural genre that i 'd often see mortals reading . \\n `` i heard you dyos so please stop complaining . \\n i told you that i was sorry , but i had to meet with her alone . '' \\n `` and yet , she did not tell you how to stop the plague . \\n what 's with gods and their half missions ? '' \\n `` do not worry about my mission . \\n what did you and grethen talk about while i was gone ? \\n i heard you raffled through his things . '' \\n `` who told you that ? \\n did he tell you that ? '' \\n dyos said pointing towards the kitchen area where grethen was making us dinner . \\n i did n't know what he was cooking , but it smelled delicious . \\n i had n't eaten since earlier during my ride here to arwid . \\n `` i heard it from samr . '' \\n `` well is n't she a nosey one . '' \\n i sighed and gave a roll of my eyes . \\n `` just tell me what the two of you were talking about . '' \\n `` the cure . \\n i told him about your mother and the venom that was keeping her bedridden . \\n he had n't heard of any such venom so he promised he would help us find it . \\n i also hate to tell you this aristaeus , but i think he was a bit sweet on your mother . \\n when i told him that she was sick , he looked bizarre . '' \\n `` maybe you saw wrong . '' \\n `` i saw right ! '' \\n dyos said pointing at himself . \\n he placed the blanket grethen had given him by the door . \\n he would be sleeping by the door in case a situation arose . \\n he tossed a pillow down on the homemade bed and made his way over to me . \\n `` the guy 's a bit strange , but he seems okay to trust . \\n i do n't think we will have to worry much about him betraying us . \\n i 'm usually a good character of something like that . '' \\n `` do n't i know it . '' \\n i turned my attention back to my book and became intrigue about a section in the book about a world called gaia . \\n the story was completely fiction , but it had hints of reality to it that seemed to intrigue me . \\n `` dinner is ready ! '' \\n grethen called from the kitchen . \\n dyos hopped up from beside me and headed over toward the kitchen . \\n i placed a piece of scrap parchment between the pages and carried the book with me over towards the kitchen . \\n the table was covered in a red saucy meat that seemed to smell quite delicious . \\n there were cut slices of bread on the table and a jar filled with berry sauce . \\n grethen placed two mugs on the table and filled them with the same seaweed tea we 'd been drinking earlier . \\n dyos shot me a look as to say he did not want any more of the demon 's black tea . \\n i hid a smile as i sat down in the chair beside dyos . \\n `` grethen , these are some interesting books that you have . \\n they remind me of the ones i 'd often seen in the mortal world . '' \\n `` ha ! \\n the mortals wish they had novels as good as those . \\n i got them from my time in samr 's world . \\n she has collections of books . \\n she loves to read . '' \\n `` seems like you have the burning love for her . '' \\n grethen shot dyos a look that said he did not appreciate the comment . \\n `` my feelings are not like that for samr , so please do not confuse yourself . '' \\n `` whatever . \\n what is this that you 've prepared ? '' \\n dyos poked his meat with his utensil . \\n `` i smell a lot of spices . '' \\n `` you 've never had nymph before ? \\n what are they feeding you guys in the city these days ? \\n every demon has eaten nymph before . '' \\n i scooped some of the nymph meat onto my utensil . \\n there were pieces of chopped vegetables mixed within the sauce . \\n as the spoon neared my mouth , the smell of spices became even more potent . \\n i took a bite of the meat and immediately felt as if my mouth had been set on fire . \\n if i was a mortal , i would n't have been able to handle it . \\n as it were , the taste was amazing . \\n it made me feel warm . \\n `` good is n't it . '' \\n grethen said smiling . \\n `` it should be a law that all demons should eat this at least one day out of the week . \\n you should take that into consideration when you become king . '' \\n dyos scoffed . \\n `` aristaeus have better laws to enforce then spicy nymph . \\n lions meat . '' \\n he said pointing at me . \\n `` that should be a law . \\n prime meats are the best . '' \\n i shook my head and laughed at them . \\n the three of us conversed over dinner and for once i did not worry about the upcoming dangers or anything else . \\n dyos was right about grethen 's character . \\n the demon seemed to be someone we could trust and hopefully he would stay here as we go to battle . \\n he seemed to enjoy samr 's world , so he might decide to go back when the time comes . \\n i would n't blame him . \\n grethen cleared up the dishes as dyos headed off to use the bathroom . \\n i walked over to the sink to help grethen with the dishes . \\n `` dyos told me about your mother . '' \\n he placed a cup in the cabinet and grabbed another to wash . \\n `` we 're going to find a cure . \\n it 's not like kiowa to let something like this get her down . '' \\n `` did you know my mother well ? '' \\n grethen turned off the water and placed the last cup away . \\n he wiped his hands off on a cloth and turned to me . \\n `` let 's just say , your father did not deserve her . '' \\n giving me a smile he left me alone into the kitchen and left the room . \\n dyos appeared in the kitchen . \\n `` we better get some sleep . \\n we got to head back tomorrow . '' \\n `` yeah . '' \\n the two of us got comfortable in our homemade beds . \\n as soon as dyos head hit the pillow , he was out like a light . \\n i moved around on the sofa trying to get comfortable . \\n aristaeus . \\n i sat up on the sofa and stared around the room . \\n this voice was not samr , but it was familiar . \\n sliding on my boots , i made my way over towards the door . \\n making sure not to wake dyos , i stepped over him and removed the stone . \\n closing the stone behind me , i turned to see someone i did not expect to see too soon . \\n zeus stood in the same spot samr had occupied earlier , with astraea at his side . \\n twenty-two zeus stared across the forest at me . \\n i was surprised to see the god in front of me and even more surprised that he 'd brought astraea along . \\n for a second i thought that this was going to be some kind of final farewell , but i instantly dismissed that thought . \\n zeus did n't seem like the type to go through all of that trouble over first love . \\n my eyes moved to astraea as she smiled happily at me from behind her father 's back . \\n i could hear different phrases such as i miss you . \\n i love you , float through her head . \\n zeus grimaced at the last one . \\n he might have been the king of gods , but he was still a father . \\n `` why are you here ? '' \\n i asked once i could n't take the suspense any more . \\n `` i 've thought long and hard about our last discussion sacrilege . '' \\n `` can you please not call me that ? \\n i do have a name . '' \\n zeus smiled as his teeth shined in the night . \\n `` yes , of course you do . \\n forgive me aristaeus . \\n i 've come to give my acceptance of your relationship with my daughter . '' \\n i stared at him confused . \\n i was happy that he 'd finally accepted us , but i was suspicious as well . \\n `` what changed ? '' \\n `` i do not wish to see my daughter suffer anymore . \\n she has made it quite clear that she would continue to see you even if it means losing my trust . \\n the love she has for you is of something i have never seen , just as your creation . \\n i find it strange , your creation . \\n but i know there has to be a good reason for it . \\n i 've also had the chance to watch you and noticed that you 're not a terrible creature . \\n you 're a bit disobedient , but i know the reason for it . '' \\n `` i want you to know that i would do nothing to hurt your daughter . '' \\n zeus nodded . \\n `` i 'm sure you wo n't . \\n i trust you . '' \\n zeus stepped to the side and glanced at his daughter . \\n astraea stared up at him as the two silently communicated . \\n i could n't detect what they were saying since they were blocking their thoughts . \\n i could n't wait to learn how to block mine . \\n i 'm sure zeus would feel the same . \\n i doubt he wanted to hear the thoughts that came to mind when i saw his daughter . \\n the contact between them broke as astraea reached over to give him a hug . \\n she then ran forward as i opened my arms to catch her . \\n i held her tightly in my arms as she wrapped her arms around me sighing . \\n `` how have you been ? '' \\n `` i 've been fine . '' \\n i assured her . \\n `` what about you ? '' \\n `` i 'm okay . '' \\n we shared another hug before separating . \\n zeus stood there with a small smile on his face . \\n nodding to me he turned to leave when i remembered i needed to talk to him . \\n `` wait ! '' \\n i unattached myself from astraea and took a few steps forward . \\n `` i thought i should tell you , that my father plans to start a war with you . '' \\n `` what ? '' \\n astraea said confused . \\n `` what do you mean -- '' `` i already know . '' \\n zeus said cutting her off . \\n `` your father has been planning this for a while so it is no surprise . \\n we will not fight with the king unless he breaks the rule by leaving the gates . \\n he knows this and he knows what will happen to his kingdom if he does . '' \\n `` that 's the point . \\n i do n't think he cares anymore . \\n he has n't been his self lately . \\n eris has him off track . '' \\n `` he 's not the only one . '' \\n zeus mumbled quietly . \\n remembering we were there , he turned to face . \\n `` do not worry about this . \\n enjoy your time together . '' \\n he turned to astraea . \\n `` i 'll see you home soon . '' \\n `` yes , father . '' \\n there was a bright flash of light and then he was gone . \\n i turned towards astraea who was glancing towards the sky . \\n i clasped her hand in mine as she turned her attention back to me . \\n `` i 'm glad you are okay . \\n i was worried . '' \\n `` so was i. my father was furious at me . \\n i had to go to court . \\n they stripped me of my rank . '' \\n `` what rank are you now ? '' \\n `` about the same rank as an angel . '' \\n i stared at the sullen look on her face . \\n i knew that her rank was important to her , but because of me , she jeopardized it . \\n i wish there was some way i could get her rank back for her , but i knew it was a lost cause . \\n zeus had been lenient on her . \\n this was the only way he could teach her a lesson , without completely destroying her . \\n `` i heard about your mother , i 'm sorry . '' \\n she said . \\n `` it 's okay . \\n i 'm going into the marketplace tomorrow to see if i can find a cure for her . \\n the demon i 'm staying with told me there might be a chance one of the barters have heard of it . '' \\n `` i wish there was some way i could use my powers , but i do n't have much anymore . '' \\n she then glanced at the cabin i was staying in . \\n `` where did you meet the demon ? '' \\n `` he 's the one who brought me to my parents that night . '' \\n `` grethen ? '' \\n she said asked . \\n i nodded . \\n `` how did you find him ? '' \\n i recapped everything that led up to me coming here and finding grethen . \\n i wanted to tell her more about samr , but i made a promise that i would keep her a secret . \\n once again i felt as if i was doing something wrong , and was ridden with guilt . \\n when the time is right , i would tell her everything . \\n `` i knew there had to be some reason you were created . '' \\n she gushed happily . \\n `` i told the others this . \\n athena thinks i might be right , while poseidon believes you 're working for eris . '' \\n `` i do n't think he will ever forgive me for burning him . '' \\n `` probably not . '' \\n she laughed . \\n i smiled . \\n i missed her laugh . \\n astraea seemed to hear my thoughts as her smile grew bigger . \\n leaning over to me , she planted a soft kiss on my lips . \\n i felt my eyes close as warmth spread through me . \\n it was moments like this and dinner earlier that i found myself wishing for peace . \\n someday , once i have accomplished the duties set out for me , i would love to live in samr 's world with astraea . \\n it seemed like a stress free place which was something i needed right about now . \\n astraea pulled back from the kiss as her eyes changed from red to yellow . \\n `` i should let you get some rest . \\n you have a big day tomorrow . '' \\n `` no , i 'm okay . \\n stay . \\n i have n't seen you in a while . '' \\n i moved a piece of stray hair back behind her ear . \\n `` besides , i need you to teach me how to block my thoughts '' `` why do you want to block your thoughts ? '' \\n `` so your dad wo n't hear the impure thoughts i have about you . '' \\n i said with all honesty . \\n astraea smiled dropped as she ducked her eyes from me . \\n i bet if she 'd been mortal , a blush would be forming up her cheeks right now . \\n `` have i embarrassed you ? '' \\n she shook her head . \\n `` no , you have n't . \\n it 's just i 've never heard anyone speak to me that way . \\n i like it . '' \\n `` do n't tell me the gods live by a virginity code . '' \\n i teased . \\n it would really fit the myths of mortals if the gods were all work and no play . \\n sounds like a pretty boring life to me . \\n astraea tapped my hand playfully . \\n `` do not turn your nose up at us . \\n i have you to know that gods throw the best parties and sometimes they can get pretty wild . '' \\n `` how wild ? '' \\n the two of us turned towards the cabin . \\n dyos stood leaning against the stone , his ankles crossed and a smirk on his face . \\n at the sight of him , astraea grew embarrassed and her eyes darted around for a place to hide . \\n i shot dyos a look of annoyance and i knew he was trying to make her uncomfortable on purpose . \\n `` when did you come out here ? \\n i thought you were sleep . '' \\n `` i was . \\n but grethen 's loud snoring woke me up . \\n i noticed you were gone and came to check on you . '' \\n dyos walked over to us and tucked his hands in his pockets . \\n `` you should have told me you were going out god hunting . \\n hello . '' \\n `` hello . '' \\n astraea mumbled . \\n `` so please continue with your story . \\n how wild does a god party get ? '' \\n i rolled my eyes . \\n `` do n't mind him . \\n he 's like annoying gnat , he 'll eventually go away . '' \\n dyos faked a gasp as astraea laughed . \\n `` i do not mind . \\n i 've wanted to meet your friend . \\n i 've seen him a few times with you , he 's quite the character . '' \\n dyos bowed at her compliment . \\n standing back upright he asked , `` so what are you two doing out here in the night . \\n you do know it 's against the rules of the king to be wandering around while everyone is asleep . '' \\n `` you 're one to talk . \\n you 've broken that rule more than anyone i know . \\n besides , astraea was about to teach me how to block my thoughts . '' \\n `` ooh magic tricks ! '' \\n dyos gushed . \\n he planted himself on a boulder near us . \\n `` let 's see then . '' \\n astraea looked at me and i sighed . \\n dyos would not be leaving anytime soon and i knew i was partly to blame for it because of my disappearing act i 'd done earlier with samr . \\n `` let him stay . '' \\n astraea began to help me practice to block my thoughts as dyos watched us . \\n we tried several times , the first couple of times proving to be quite difficult . \\n i never thought it would be this hard to simply block a thought from someone . \\n i 'd done it before when it came to hiding information from my father , but for some reason i could not do it now . \\n we must have tried twenty more times before i finally got the hang of it . \\n after that , astraea and i said our goodbyes . \\n i kissed her and she promised she would be back soon to see me . \\n we knew she had to be careful entering our world now that my father had plans to go to war with them . \\n astraea disappeared in the sky , as dyos and i headed back into the cabin to finally get some sleep . \\n twenty-three the next morning we headed back towards the marketplace in arwid . \\n there was only three days left until the plague would reach the world of pearu . \\n grethen had agreed to accompany us to the marketplace , but he drew the line there . \\n he had no intentions of going into the city of pearu . \\n he did n't want the chance of the king spotting him and arresting him for questioning . \\n after fixing us a heavy breakfast of more nymph , the three of us set out . \\n dyos seemed to be in a much better mood today as he conversed with grethen about his travels around the world of pearu . \\n grethen in returned shared with him his travels among the mortal world which dyos found to be quite interesting . \\n the two had seemed to form a brotherhood somewhere between my shower and breakfast . \\n i hoped that the new brotherhood would be enough to help grethen accompany us to battle . \\n it was a long shot , but stranger things in the world have happened . \\n `` i wonder if that orc is still there from yesterday . \\n i still would like some of that unicorn bread . '' \\n dyos said . \\n `` i tell you dyos , the best thing to serve with unicorn bread is the nymph i made for you guys . '' \\n `` enough talk of nymph you old fool . \\n is that all you eat ? \\n you should try more prime meats . '' \\n `` nymph is all the prime meat that a demon should need . '' \\n the two of them carried on like this until we made it back to the market . \\n we peered through the trees at the barters that were moving around the marketplace like normal . \\n `` wait here . '' \\n grethen . \\n `` i 'll go smooth things out with the locals . '' \\n he left us concealed in the trees as he made his way over to some of the barters . \\n the barters gave him looks of relief that he was alive . \\n i could hear them questioning him on the events of yesterday . \\n grethen assured them that it was all a big misunderstanding , mostly on his part . \\n i thought it was nice of him to take the blame . \\n `` listen to this old fool . '' \\n dyos said . \\n `` i ca n't believe he 's taking the blame . '' \\n `` he 's saving our throats . '' \\n `` he 's messing with our street cred is what he 's doing . '' \\n dyos complained . \\n `` i 've built a reputation here in arwid and he 's messing up the works . '' \\n `` dyos , do me a favor and be quiet . '' \\n dyos mumbled a smart comment as grethen made his way back over to us . \\n it appeared that the barters decided to trust him . \\n `` come on out you two , they 're fine with you . '' \\n we stumbled out the woods behind grethen as he led us through the marketplace . \\n dyos had stopped to buy bread from the orc from yesterday until he remembered that he did n't have any more money . \\n now , he was in a sour mood , snapping at everyone that bumped into him . \\n `` grethen , where did you say the guy that might have the cure was located . '' \\n i asked . \\n we 'd passed several booths , but none held the potions we were after . \\n `` he is just up here . \\n he likes to be close towards the front of the marketplace for ailing customers . '' \\n we headed through the marketplace . \\n the crowd today was thinner compared to yesterday . \\n dyos seemed to have taken notice of it too , but he had yet to say something about it . \\n i figured it had something to do with our actions yesterday , though i was n't sure . \\n we finally reached the front of the marketplace as we came to a table where another orc was stationed . \\n we waited for him to get finish selling a potion to a customer before he turned to us . \\n `` grethen my boy , it 's good to see you in one piece . \\n who do you have here with you ? '' \\n `` the chasers from yesterday . \\n we 've seen to come to an accord . '' \\n `` ah ! '' \\n said the orc . \\n he reached up to scratch at the long strands of gray hair that hung from his chin . \\n his nails were long like mine , but while mine shined , his were covered in dirt and some sticky green residue . \\n `` that is best thing to have with one 's enemy . \\n how can i be of service to you ? '' \\n `` we 're looking for a cure . '' \\n i said . \\n `` a good friend of mine was attacked by a blade that was dipped in venom . \\n the beast the venom belongs to is unknown . \\n we 've tried everything , but the healing potions we have only seemed to heal the wound for a few seconds before spreading worse . '' \\n the orc tapped his chin as he stared at me . \\n `` this venom you speak of is not one that i have ran across . '' \\n he moved his hand off his chin and raised a finger . \\n `` but that does not mean it does n't exist . '' \\n the orc turned towards the shelf at the back of his booth that was filled with books . \\n we waited as he thumbed through the material trying to find the right potion . \\n after going through four books , he finally found the one that he needed . \\n `` aha , i think i have a solution . \\n this potion is not a definite cure for whatever your friend has contacted , but it should work . '' \\n `` are you positive ? '' \\n i asked . \\n `` of that i can not be sure for i do not know the beast that attacked your friend . \\n however , this potion has been used on plenty unknown venoms and has removed them from injured creatures . \\n i 'm sure it can do the same too . '' \\n i figured the orc was right . \\n this potion would be better than nothing . \\n i dare think how bad kiowa 's wound has gotten since i 've been gone . \\n i knew the medics were doing all they could for her , but i still wished i could just reach in and remove the poisonous stream from her body . \\n the orc mixed up the ingredients needed for the potion and placed it inside of a clear bottle . \\n he handed it over to me and wrote down a set of instructions on a piece of parchment paper . \\n `` make sure to give your friend only three drops . \\n we do n't want to anger venom any more that necessary . '' \\n `` thank you . '' \\n i said to him as grethen handed him a bag of scales . \\n `` no worries , young demon . '' \\n he opened the bag and sniffed the dragon scales . \\n satisfied with payment , he turned his attention back to grethen . \\n `` can i get you something today ? \\n you have n't been to see me in a while . '' \\n `` no thanks . \\n i wo n't be around here for a while . '' \\n `` very well then , we shall wish you on a safe journey . '' \\n we left the orc 's booth and took a few steps away from his booth . \\n grethen 's words to the orc played in my mind . \\n while dyos went to go obtain a carriage , i turned to face grethen . \\n `` what do you mean you wo n't be around for a while ? \\n i thought you said you were n't venturing to the city . '' \\n `` i 'm not . \\n i 'm heading back to samr 's world . '' \\n i knew it was coming , but i guess i was n't exactly ready for us to part ways . \\n i had n't grown an attachment or formed a brotherhood like he and dyos had , but i still found him to be a good companion . \\n `` why are you leaving so soon ? '' \\n `` my work here is done aristaeus . \\n it 's time i return home to receive my next assignment . '' \\n `` assignment ? '' \\n `` surely you did not think that we met here by coincidence . '' \\n grethen chuckled . \\n `` it 's time you start realizing that there are no such things as coincidences . \\n i knew you were coming to the marketplace to find samr . \\n i just had to make it seem like i did n't . \\n samr sent me . '' \\n `` why ? '' \\n `` because you were not ready to see her yet . \\n you needed to get the full story from someone else . \\n as you may have noticed , samr does not like to spend too much time in this world . \\n we ca n't chance lilith or eris spotting her . '' \\n i sighed . \\n `` i understand . \\n i just hoped that you would join us in the battle . '' \\n `` it is not my battle , though i do love a good fight . '' \\n dyos came back towards us as a carriage followed . \\n he still looked upset about not getting his bread , but i knew when we arrived in the city , he would be back to normal . \\n `` what 's with the atmosphere ? '' \\n `` grethen is going home . '' \\n i told him . \\n i expected dyos to take grethen 's departure harder , but he did n't . \\n he gave the demon a hug and patted his shoulder . \\n `` i ca n't believe you 're missing out on a good fight . \\n listen if samr does n't have plans for you , you should definitely come back and join us . '' \\n grethen laughed and patted dyos head . \\n `` you hellions take care . \\n the next couple of days are about to bring more pain and destruction than you 've ever seen in your lives . \\n dyos you make sure to stay by aristaeus side . \\n he is going to need you if he is to succeed in his mission . '' \\n `` i will . '' \\n grethen patted both of our shoulders before walking off back towards his cabin . \\n `` can you believe that ? \\n he 's just leaving us . \\n the least he could so was send us off with some bowls of nymph . \\n the manners of the elite were just completely wasted on him . '' \\n i laughed at dyos and headed towards the carriage . \\n we climbed in the carriage as it pulled us to a start and headed back to the city of pearu . \\n the carriage headed down the dirt road of the countryside of arwid as i pulled out the battle plans i 'd kept on me . \\n my journals were lost , but since they were new , i could always rewrite my entries . \\n `` so my father plans to open the gates . '' \\n `` that 's what i got from the maps . \\n the drawings on the map indicated the different places the creatures of pearu would head in the mortal world . \\n his battle plan seems to include spreading out the guards so they can take on the gods one on one . '' \\n i sighed . \\n `` my father has lost all sense lately . \\n there may be few gods , but they are powerful . \\n it would not take them long to destroy his demon guards and move on to the next one . \\n not to forget , the archangels and the guild . \\n this battle will not take long to be over . \\n i just hate that with it , there will be mortal casualties . '' \\n `` what do you mean mortal casualties ? '' \\n `` do you honestly expect my father to have fair fight ? \\n he 's been brewing up potions to possess eris powers . \\n i 'm sure he has n't quite captured the powers she possesses -- but he has captured something . \\n he 's been waiting for this battle for a while . \\n he wo n't go in empty handed . '' \\n `` let 's just hope you can change his mind when you tell him about the plague . \\n that should become first priority . \\n you just have to find a way to convince him without mentioning samr . '' \\n `` believe me i 'm hurting my head trying to think of a way . \\n did you gather anymore information while you were digging ? '' \\n `` yes , i did . '' \\n dyos reached into his coat pocket and removed some folded parchment paper . \\n `` i found a list of names of the soldiers being used in the battle . \\n i also found out that your father has been digging into the two places where you said the portals were at . \\n i think he 's trying to find another way outside of the world into the mortal world . '' \\n `` i told him those portals are no longer there . \\n does he not listen to me ? '' \\n `` of course he does n't . \\n i thought you would have learned that by now . '' \\n i folded the papers and handed them over to dyos . \\n he would keep them safe while i was at the palace . \\n `` it does not matter . \\n he wo n't find anything . \\n let 's just keep focus on lilith . \\n she 's the reason i 'm here . \\n she 's the enemy . '' \\n dyos and i talked with each other as we left arwid and headed for the city . \\n dyos eventually grew tired of all the battle talk and took a nap . \\n i took the time to finish reading the novel that grethen had allowed me to hold . \\n he 'd given me two more books saying that he 'd already read those . \\n i was happy to take them off my hand . \\n skimming through the book , i found myself becoming lost in the fiction story about a woman who seemed to possess the powers of four creatures such as a wolf , witch , fairy , and vampire . \\n i followed her journey as she came to terms with what she was as she searched for more like her , leading them into a world of safety . \\n somewhere along the lines , we 'd arrived in the city . \\n the carriage headed down the cobblestone street coming to a stop near the many shops . \\n i shook dyos awake and put away my book . \\n he woke up and stretched , his mouth stretching wider than that of a lion . \\n `` are you sure you do not wish for the carriage to take you home ? '' \\n `` no thanks . \\n i plan on enjoying a few drinks and the company of a lady . \\n after all , tomorrow is n't promised . '' \\n he exited the carriage and bowed to me . \\n the door closed as the carriage pulled back to a start taking me to the palace . \\n i held the potion in my hand as i said a silent prayer that it would work and save kiowa . \\n i knew it was abnormal for a creature of my kind to pray for the wellbeing of another , but i was hoping the creator take pity on me and save the only mother that i 've ever knew . \\n the carriage ride to the palace came to a stop . \\n the door to the carriage opened as the guard bent to bow to me . \\n `` welcome home , your highness . '' \\n i stepped out of the carriage as he closed the door . \\n `` where are my parents ? '' \\n `` the king is in a meeting with the courant . \\n the queen is still in bed . '' \\n `` she has n't gotten any better . '' \\n i asked . \\n `` it appears not your highness . '' \\n dryness strangled my throat as i tried to push away the dark feelings . \\n i could n't let these feeling attack me . \\n it would have me depressed and then no one would be able to help her . \\n getting control of myself , i headed into the palace . \\n the servants were hurried back and forth with candles and dinner plates . \\n they were all in a panic and i knew that the courant would be spending a night in the palace . \\n i headed up to kiowa 's room with the potion in my hand . \\n the door was already opened and the smell of death hit me . \\n kiowa lay still in the bed as i felt myself come to a stop . \\n for a minute , i feared i was too late . \\n but kiowa 's head turned in my direction and she smiled . \\n `` you 're home . '' \\n giving her a shaky smile , i hurried over to her side . \\n her body was covered in sweat and as i touched her hand , i felt coldness . \\n `` where is the medic ? \\n why is n't anyone in here with you ? '' \\n `` do not cause a fuss aristaeus . \\n your father has them preparing rooms and dinner for the courant . \\n they are planning to stay the night here at the palace . '' \\n i felt anger surge in me towards my father . \\n did he not care that his wife was lying in the bed rotting away . \\n no , all he seemed to care about was maintaining his manners as part of the elite . \\n `` i brought you something to help remove the venom . '' \\n i said to her . \\n i placed the potion on the side table and turned to help her sit up . \\n kiowa had never been a heavy creature , but as i lifted her , i could literally feel the bones in her body . \\n she moaned in pain as i got her situated against the pillow . \\n once i was done moving her , she sighed in relief . \\n i grabbed the potion bottle and unhooked the top . \\n grabbing the dropper that was sitting in her table , i dipped it in the potion , filling it up . \\n kiowa opened her mouth as i turned and hang the dropper over her mouth . \\n i squeezed releasing three drops as the orc told me . \\n `` thank you . '' \\n she breathed out . \\n `` you do not have to thank me for trying to save your life . '' \\n kiowa smiled and grabbed my hand . \\n `` did you have a good time in arwid ? \\n i know dyos was with you , his father called here in a rage i heard . '' \\n `` we did n't have much time to relax like we usually did . \\n i went there to find the woman who sold you the moonstone ring . '' \\n kiowa stared at me . \\n `` did you find her ? '' \\n i did n't want to worry kiowa with what i 'd learned , especially while she was in this state . \\n so i told her no . \\n i promised myself that when she got better , i would explain everything to her then . \\n but by that , she would probably already know the truth . \\n i could n't exactly hide an entire plague from her . \\n i stayed with her a little longer catching up . \\n she missed her garden and being able to visit the library . \\n i promised her that i would go down and pick out some of her favorite flowers . \\n the servants had only brought dragon lilies . \\n they did n't seem to have a clue what their queen seemed to love . \\n i could n't blame them , they were new . \\n kiowa finally fell asleep and i left her room . \\n i headed downstairs to my father 's study . \\n there were several guards standing outside the door , some ours and some guards of the courant . \\n i walked up towards the door but one of the guards put his hand up . \\n `` i 'm sorry prince . \\n the king has asked not to be disturbed . '' \\n `` i 'm just going in to let him know that i am home . '' \\n `` the king already knows that you are home . \\n he asked for you to wait in the library . \\n he will meet with you once he is done with his meeting . '' \\n i rolled my eyes at the guard . \\n my impulses made me want to push him to the side and enter despite what he was telling me , but i would not win any points over with my father . \\n i needed him calm for when i told him about the plague . \\n deciding to give up , i left and headed towards my quarters . \\n i had no intentions of going to the library at the moment . \\n i made my way to my room and closed and locked the door . \\n i made sure my windows were closed and that there were no lingering servants in my bathroom . \\n when the coast was clear , i made my way to the center of the room . \\n closing my eyes , i decided to practice calling forth my powers . \\n when it came to swords , battle axes , and hand to hand combat , i was a professional . \\n however , with my new change , it brought new powers . \\n concentrating , i allowed myself to breathe in and out . \\n images of eris using her powers seemed to motivate me . \\n i pulled up images on the way she moved her face or the way she positioned her hands . \\n i pushed myself further by thinking of the pain she caused kiowa . \\n at first , there was nothing . \\n there was no power coming from my hand , and then , there was a change in the atmosphere . \\n my room felt as if it was running with bolts of electricity . \\n shock waves surged through my body as i felt a tingling in my hand . \\n i opened my eyes and stared at the floating white ball in my hand . \\n the ball lifted and hovered slightly in my hand . \\n my moonstone ring shined with bright light as well . \\n i pushed my hand out as the ball left my hand . \\n the ball flew out my hand across the room . \\n the light smashed into the figurines in my room , knocking them into pieces as they fell to the floor . \\n the ball caught on the ends of the pearu crest tapestry also that hung on my wall . \\n the tapestry lit up in flames as i stared in shock . \\n grabbing the washing bowl off the counter , i hurried to my bathroom and filled it in water . \\n by the time i made it back to my room , the flames had made it halfway up the tapestry . \\n i tossed the water on the tapestry completely putting it out . \\n a knock sounded at my door making me jump . \\n i tossed the bowl to the side and tried to fan the burning smell away . \\n the knock sounded again . \\n the smell would not leave , and i could not make it . \\n hurrying over to the door , i pulled it open . \\n i blocked the entrance of my room and stared at the servant . \\n `` yes , what is it ? '' \\n `` the king requested your presence . '' \\n i slid through the door making sure to block the view . \\n the servant gave me a concerned glance but did not say anything . \\n `` lead the way . '' \\n the servant led me down the stairs to the library . \\n she opened the door and stepped to the side as i stepped in . \\n my eyes went around the room until i spotted my father on the second floor . \\n i made my way up the curved staircase to the second floor . \\n my father stood in front of one of the shelves , his attention on whatever book he was reading . \\n i came to a stop in front of him . \\n `` father . '' \\n `` i thought i told you to wait for me in here . '' \\n `` i had to take care of something . \\n you did not wait very long . '' \\n my father shut the book he was reading . \\n he turned to place it on the shelf . \\n `` did you enjoy your trip ? '' \\n `` it was eventful . '' \\n i said not giving him much . \\n `` why did you call all the servants away from mother ? \\n she needs them more than ever now . '' \\n `` aristaeus , we have to keep to the rules despite any tragedies that have taken place in the palace . \\n we do not lose ourselves just because we are experiencing hardships . '' \\n `` you care more about the elite than your wife who is lying in your bed dying ! '' \\n my father shot me a harden glare . \\n so apparently he was aware of kiowa 's condition . \\n it just seemed the courant was more important than her at the moment . \\n `` your mother will be fine . \\n what she needs is sleep . \\n she does n't need you hovering over her babying her every second of the day . \\n you went to arwid and got the cure did n't you ? '' \\n `` i got a cure . \\n it 's not definite that it will help . '' \\n `` well we 'll just have faith . \\n do not let your emotions get the best of you . '' \\n i wanted to tell him that he was the one to talk . \\n he was allowing his emotions for eris and all these attacks drive him to do insane things . \\n he had lost what he once stood for and was now making careless mistakes . \\n `` why are the courant here ? '' \\n i asked . \\n `` did something happen ? '' \\n my father walked past me tucking his hands behind his back . \\n i followed behind him . \\n `` we are meeting to discuss battle plans and the future of pearu . '' \\n `` so you 're really going to go through with this . '' \\n `` aristaeus , the time has come that we stand up against these gods . \\n we have bowed down and took their criticism since the day our worlds were created . \\n i will not let my people submit to these righteous winged beasts any longer . '' \\n i scoffed and came to a stop . \\n `` who fed you that speech ? \\n was it the courant or was it all the rumors around pearu calling you weak ? '' \\n my father came to a stop . \\n his shoulders were raised high . \\n `` i do not expect you to understand . \\n you 've changed so of course you will side with them . '' \\n `` cut the nonsense father . \\n i thought this was a suicide mission before i changed and i still think so . \\n you are going to lead our world into misfortune . \\n i will not stand for it ! '' \\n my father turned on around his eyes wide . \\n i could sense the anger in him as his true face broke through his mortal one . \\n `` how dare you question me ? \\n i am king ! \\n i have ruled this world far longer than you have ever been thought of . \\n you will not go against me . \\n you will join us to fight the gods ! '' \\n `` there are more important things than fighting the gods ! '' \\n i yelled back . \\n i stared across at my father . \\n my true face had emerged as well . \\n it seemed to bring shock to my father . \\n i guess he thought with my change , that part of me would not be shown again . \\n it was enough to get him back into control . \\n his face settled back into mortal form as he smoothed out his blazer . \\n `` what are you trying to tell me ? '' \\n he said once he was back in control . \\n my face had retreated as well as i tamed the anger in me . \\n `` father , i know why lilith has shown herself in pearu . \\n she plans to release a plague in pearu . '' \\n `` plague ? \\n what do you mean plague ? '' \\n `` eris has found the cosmic orb that her father was once assigned to guard . \\n the cosmic orb has been tainted with a spell that would only open once it had received a certain amount of mortal souls . \\n that is why she had lilith break into the vault at belham 's . \\n she needed the souls for the orb . \\n if she releases this plague in pearu . \\n it will be the end of our world . '' \\n `` where did you get this information ? '' \\n this is where things got hard . \\n i could n't tell my father that i 'd learn this from samr or grethen without causing another alarm in him . \\n `` i learned this while i was in arwid . '' \\n my father scoffed and began to chuckle . \\n `` are you listening to wild tales now aristaeus ? '' \\n `` it is not a tale . \\n this plague is real and it will be here in four days . '' \\n `` this is why you are not ready to be king yet . \\n you go around believing every little thing someone tells you . \\n i would think with your transformation that you would wise up and learn to take your position seriously . \\n there is no such thing as a cosmic orb . \\n whoever told you this was probably recognized that you were of elite and wanted some dragon scales from you . '' \\n i shook my head in frustration . \\n `` this is not about money father . \\n you said yourself that you found it strange that the rogue would choose this moment to suddenly appear . \\n you ca n't believe that this all about coincidence . \\n eris has planned this ever since she was cast to live in this world . \\n she wants to see this world destroyed . '' \\n `` see that is where you 're wrong . \\n eris would never destroy a world she worked so hard to build up . \\n it would all be a waste of time . \\n she is after the throne . \\n she always has been . \\n and with the way you 're acting , she is going to end up getting it before you do . \\n now i want you to drop this nonsense about this plague . '' \\n `` you 're making a big mistake father . \\n this plague is coming and if you do n't prepare yourself for it , you will go down as the king who let the world of pearu meet its end . '' \\n my father and i stared each other down . \\n i knew he did n't want a reputation as such . \\n i saw him think over what i said . \\n he considered that maybe i was on to something . \\n maybe eris was trying to destroy pearu along with all the other worlds . \\n just as soon as i thought he 'd come to terms and believe me , i watch distrust enter his eyes again . \\n `` i 'm sorry son , but i am not going to call forth any guards for a fake mission that does not exist when we have a real one waiting for us . '' \\n `` then i request to call forth and train my own guards for this mission . '' \\n `` request denied . '' \\n my father said . \\n `` well then i will go at it alone then . \\n it seems i am going to have to be the one to save our world from your mistakes . '' \\n `` you will do no such thing . \\n you will forget this heresy and you will join us in battle against the gods . \\n it 's time you 're proved your loyalty to me and to the world of pearu . '' \\n i stared at my father as an unsettling feeling went through me . \\n i had a feeling what he was about to say , but i prayed that he would n't say it . \\n `` what do you mean father ? '' \\n `` it 's time you to choose between the two . \\n it 's time you accept your demon side fully . '' \\n there was silence between us as the weight of his words weighed down on my shoulders . \\n like zeus , he was giving me an ultimatum . \\n he was asking me to claim my demon side , not only proving to him that i was his son , but that i was choosing the creatures of pearu over astraea . \\n he had n't accepted her like i thought he would . \\n he still hated her and he still despised what i 'd become . \\n he did not care how this kind of decision could torment me . \\n he proved it by the smirk that was on his face . \\n feeling as if i was about to collapse , i said , `` i 'm sorry father , but i can not do that . '' \\n the smirk dropped off my father 's face . \\n he stared at me in shock as if i had just betrayed him . \\n in a way , i had . \\n i 'd chosen what i believed in over his foolish mission . \\n i 'd chosen astraea over him , and my mother . \\n it hurt me to have to make that decision , but i could not accept being a full demon . \\n i was never a full hell demon to begin with . \\n i was here on a mission . \\n no matter how i felt about my parents , i could not be swayed for it . \\n `` guards ! '' \\n my father suddenly called . \\n i stared at him in confusion as guards entered the room . \\n they came rushing in at the sound of the king 's voice expecting to find an intruder . \\n at the sight of us standing there , they came to a stop behind the king , their weapons still raised . \\n `` i hereby charge , prince aristaeus priam , betrayer of the king , enemy of pearu . \\n i hereby ban him from the world of pearu , forever . '' \\n the shock that went through the room at the king words rooted everyone into place . \\n the guard 's mouths opened and closed as they stared from the king to me . \\n they 'd often seen the king giving me different punishments , but he always forgave me . \\n but to be banned from the world of pearu , to be outcast and labeled as a betrayer and enemy forever , seemed to be unheard of . \\n i was his son . \\n i was n't some criminal on the streets of arwid . \\n `` father . '' \\n i pleaded . \\n the hurt in my voice was evident . \\n i knew it hurt him for me to choose to remain a sacrilege , but i never thought he would react in this way . \\n he hated me enough to ban me from the only world i knew and from my mother . \\n he was separating me from kiowa at a time when she needed me the most . \\n turning on his heels , my father said , `` take him away . \\n i want him out of my world now . '' \\n the guards got over their shock and rushed forward . \\n staring at my father 's back , i realize that we would have to be enemies from now on . \\n not being one to be captured by my enemy , i dodged the hands of the guards . \\n i did n't want to kill any of the guards , but i would n't let them harm me as well . \\n i escaped the hands of the guards , knocking one over to the rest . \\n my father stood off to the side as i raced to the door . \\n i took one more glance at him and left the room . \\n `` capture him ! '' \\n shouted my father . \\n as i ran into the hallway towards the front door , more guards joined the fray . \\n i hit them in places that would cause them to stop as i continued to run . \\n i raced down the steps of the palace and down the driveway towards the bridge . \\n coming to the bridge , i removed my demos and sliced the roped . \\n the bridge rope snapped as the bridge hurled down . \\n glancing up at the palace , i saw kiowa standing in the window staring down at me . \\n from here i could see her eyes filled with tears . \\n placing my fingers together , i curled my pointer and thumbs until the shape resembled a heart . \\n the other fingers touched each other tips . \\n seeing the guards coming down the stairs , i raced across the bridge and away from the only home i knew . \\n the guards chased me through the city as citizens moved to the side . \\n all around me true faces emerged at the rush of a kill about to happen . \\n i circled behind one of the stone buildings and hid behind a barrel of fruit . \\n the guards raced past not seeing me in the alley . \\n i was out of the clear or so i thought until a hand clamped down on my shoulder . \\n i turned to dispatch my attacker when i saw who it was . \\n `` grethen , what are you doing here ? '' \\n grethen smiled down at me . \\n `` i decided to take your friend dyos up on his offer . \\n what kind of demon would i be if i did n't join a battle ? '' \\n i stared at grethen thankful that he 'd decided to stay . \\n i could use an ally since it seemed i was now surrounded by a world of enemies . \\n twenty-four grethen and i made it through the city without attracting the attention of any of the guards . \\n my father had worked fast in getting out wanted posters throughout the city , promising citizens a nice size bag of dragon scales . \\n he was trying to force me out by shutting off any places that i would usually hold up in . \\n it was a good plan . \\n i knew my so called friends in this world would be happy to trade me in to the king for the amount of scales he was offering . \\n they were poor citizens that had to feed their family and when it came to things like that , friends did not matter . \\n `` in here . '' \\n grethen said ducking through the back door of a building . \\n `` we 'll be safe here . \\n the owner is in mayur visiting relatives . '' \\n `` how do you know ? '' \\n i asked once we were fully in . \\n `` is samr helping us ? '' \\n `` samr is always helping . '' \\n we made our way through the shop away from the back door . \\n grethen headed towards the front and peered out the window . \\n i glanced out the other side . \\n the streets were filled with citizens as they stood in groups watching the guards patrol up and down the streets . \\n a couple of them held my wanted poster in their hand as they chatted animatedly about it . \\n `` i have to get word to dyos . \\n i worry that my father will capture him just in case i try to make contact with him . '' \\n `` your father wo n't harm dyos . '' \\n grethen said stepping back from the window closing the curtain . \\n `` his father is the general and he needs to stay in his good graces . \\n but you are right . \\n we need to get dyos and head to arwid . \\n we wo n't be safe in the city for too long . \\n i have a feeling that your father will keep day running until he finds you . '' \\n `` wo n't the guards find me in arwid ? '' \\n `` arwid is a close tight community . \\n even though your father is the king , he does not get much pull around there . \\n the citizens do not even respect their own prince . \\n arwid do what they want without asking permission . \\n if i ask them to , they will hide us . \\n we will be safe there . '' \\n i nodded and walked over to a stool and sat down . \\n my thoughts were streaming with different emotions as i tried not to break down in front of grethen . \\n i always joked with dyos about the day my father would disown me , but i never thought it would happen . \\n i never thought that he would grow such a hate that he would actually ban me away from pearu . \\n maybe he never cared for me at all . \\n i was only an irritating puzzle to him that he had to find out the answers to . \\n my felt suddenly felt dry as i stood up . \\n i thought i was going to suffocate . \\n grethen placed a hand on my shoulder . \\n `` it is okay aristaeus . \\n it is okay to cry . '' \\n and i did . \\n tears streamed down my face as i finally broke down . \\n everything that had i 'd carefully locked away finally unleash and came down on me . \\n my shoulders shook in spasms as i laid my head on the counter . \\n grethen patted my shoulder throughout it all not saying anything . \\n he knew this was something that had been harboring in me and that i needed to get out . \\n as i cried , i was aware that there was someone else crying . \\n i stopped my sobs some so i could hear . \\n it was the voice of a woman as she cried . \\n i realized it was samr . \\n samr was crying with me . \\n it was n't much , but it was enough to cause me to stop crying . \\n i did n't want to hear her crying . \\n i could n't handle it . \\n wiping my face , i sat up . \\n `` feel better ? '' \\n grethen asked stepping back to allow me to stand . \\n `` much better . '' \\n `` good . \\n i do n't want you to worry about getting the letter to dyos . \\n i will go and get him myself . \\n when we return , we will head to arwid . \\n in the meantime , pack up some things we might need in here on our trip . '' \\n i nodded . \\n `` thank you grethen . '' \\n `` you 're welcome , your highness . '' \\n i stared at grethen as he bowed to me . \\n standing back upright , he gave me a smile and turned to head back out the back door . \\n `` i wo n't be long . '' \\n the door closed behind him and i was left alone in silence . \\n i could n't believe that grethen had bowed to me . \\n he had never shown any respect for my father or the courant , but here he was bowing to me and calling me in a manner of the elite . \\n moving around the store , i searched through the jars that were on the cupboard . \\n we would need some things to barter . \\n i did n't have any money and i doubt dyos would have time to grab any once grethen arrived . \\n i could n't count on the money that grethen had on him either . \\n it seemed he made most of his money in the marketplace . \\n we would have to do the same . \\n i found a couple of things that we could use with us on our trip . \\n grabbing a bag from behind the counter , i filled the sack with jam , cloth , medicine , and other materials . \\n by the time i was done , and had filled two bags , the back door opened revealing grethen along with dyos . \\n `` aristaeus ! \\n are you okay ? '' \\n dyos said rushing towards me . \\n `` i heard what happened from my father . \\n i ca n't believe the king has resorted to doing this . '' \\n `` join the club friend . '' \\n `` well did you at least have the chance to give kiowa the potion ? '' \\n `` yes , i gave her the required drops . \\n but i did not get to say goodbye to her . \\n everything happened so fast . '' \\n i said . \\n dyos put a hand on my shoulder to comfort me . \\n i hated that i was pulling him from his family and knew it would cause problems for him when he returned . \\n however , he did n't seem to mind it . \\n `` we can catch up and chat later . \\n we need to get out of the city now . '' \\n grethen said . \\n he grabbed one of the bags and dyos grabbed the other one . \\n `` aristaeus , you are the best fighter out of us , we will need you to be armed . '' \\n `` okay . '' \\n `` let 's go . '' \\n we left out the back door and headed back into the alley . \\n the streets were still filled with noise as we inched towards the opening of the alley , keeping behind some discarded cases and garbage . \\n `` we 'll have to camden street instead of the main road . \\n the main road will be under heavy surveillance by the guards . '' \\n `` would n't they be watching camden street as well ? '' \\n dyos asked . \\n `` not really . \\n the guards and the kingdom have forgotten about camden street since zobyverth was captured by the gods . \\n many believe the street to be curse so they avoid it . \\n they wo n't remember the street until it 's too late . \\n by then we 'll already be heading out of the city . '' \\n deciding to follow grethen , we waited until the streets were clear before heading across . \\n we kept our head down as we passed different creatures . \\n i was thankful that i had n't changed back into the palace colors like i started to when i arrived . \\n i was still dressed in the blazer i 'd worn when i last been in arwid . \\n we made it to camden street without any trouble . \\n instead of walking like we 'd been doing , we ran . \\n camden street was a very long road that curved around a group of trees hiding us from the view of the main road . \\n we would n't stop running until we felt that we were completely covered from the sight of the guards . \\n our boots hit the ground as we ran keeping in pace with each other . \\n we took turns glancing behind us to make sure we were n't being followed . \\n the view of the city began to disappear as we reached the curve of the road . \\n the view completely disappeared the further we got away from the main streets . \\n we were about to slow to a stroll when we heard the sound of a horn being blown . \\n `` someone must have spotted us ! '' \\n dyos said turning around his eyes large . \\n `` we ca n't worry about that . '' \\n grethen said . \\n `` run ! '' \\n we ran quickly down the road as the king 's horn bellowed throughout the city . \\n i could hear the faint sound of hooves and the excited cheers of the crowd . \\n the noise was n't close but it was close enough . \\n we ran until we finally reached the outskirts of the city . \\n ahead there was a cabin that loaned carriages . \\n `` look carriages , we can get one . '' \\n dyos said . \\n i shook my head . \\n `` no , my father would have already made contact to them . \\n our best bet is to keep close to the ground until we get to that forest area . '' \\n i said pointing . \\n `` we get in that forest area -- we might have a chance in making it to arwid . '' \\n `` he 's right . \\n the guards wo n't search the forests . '' \\n the three of us moved to the right side of the road and camouflaged ourselves in the grass . \\n the grass was high enough to hide us as we made our way pass the cabin . \\n there was a chimera on the porch holding a battle axe . \\n his eyes scanned the road , not even noticing us move pass him . \\n once we were out of his sight , we stood and entered the drapery of the forest . \\n the journey to arwid this time was a long one since we were on foot . \\n the sound of the following guards and carriages had ceased after being in the forest for a while . \\n it was safe to say that that they 'd assumed we 'd gone another way . \\n when we finally made it to arwid , we were sore and in need of much rest . \\n as grethen had said , the guards of prince jobson were nowhere to be found . \\n the majority of his guard were probably already in the city to assist the king in his battle , he would not send the last few he had just in case lilith or eris made an appearance . \\n we would n't have to worry about him for long either . \\n as the last remaining prince , he would be joining my father in the battle against the gods . \\n the marketplace was still in full force as we made our way through . \\n `` grethen ! '' \\n we turned to see the orc who 'd sold us the potion for kiowa . \\n he came from behind his booth leaving his customer behind . \\n `` i 'm glad you 're here . \\n eris was here ! '' \\n `` what ? ' \\n i said staring at the orc . \\n `` are you sure it was eris and not someone else ? '' \\n `` it was the queen . \\n earlier today after you guys pulled out of here . \\n she tried to enter the marketplace but we stood strong against her . \\n we knew that she was here to recruit more soldiers . \\n we 're not dumb . \\n we heard what happened to her soldiers that attacked the palace . \\n they were left to die by the hands of the gods . \\n we will not serve a coward like her . '' \\n the orc said . \\n `` you mean she allowed you guys to live . '' \\n dyos asked surprised . \\n `` i thought she would have surely killed anyone that seemed to get in her way . '' \\n `` she would have , but for some reason i do n't think she wanted to attract too much attention . '' \\n `` what do you mean ? '' \\n i asked . \\n `` well she was n't with any soldiers . \\n she had only had one creature with her , but there was something strange about him . '' \\n `` strange how . '' \\n the orc stared at us as if he was afraid to say . \\n more so , it seemed that he was embarrassed . \\n `` do n't withhold information orc , tell us about the creature . '' \\n grethen fussed . \\n `` the creature that i saw with eris , he was n't a creature of the damned . \\n he was something else . \\n he was very tall and he seemed older than the creatures here in pearu . \\n even stranger , his eyes changed every second he blinked . \\n like yours . '' \\n the orc pointed . \\n we stared at the orc before turning to each other . \\n it could n't be . \\n `` are you sure ? '' \\n i asked the orc . \\n `` are you sure the creature eyes changed colors ? '' \\n the orc rolled his eyes and gave his bumpy leg a stomp . \\n `` i think i know what i saw . \\n that creature had eyes that changed colors like a rainbow . \\n he was n't a creature of pearu . \\n maybe he was a fairy . \\n i heard they exist you know . \\n i ` ve read books about them . '' \\n the three of us tuned out the orc as he rattled on about fairies and the bags of gold they carried around with them . \\n `` a god , here in pearu . '' \\n dyos said . \\n `` and not just that , he 's with eris . '' \\n `` something about this is n't right . '' \\n grethen said staring at me . \\n he was right . \\n what was a god doing here in pearu with eris . \\n it did n't add up . \\n `` well did n't samr tell you something ? '' \\n dyos said to grethen . \\n `` she sent you back here but she did n't tell you about the god being here . '' \\n `` she does not tell me everything ! '' \\n grethen argued back . \\n `` she has her reasons . '' \\n `` i am sure . '' \\n `` enough . '' \\n i said getting in between them . \\n `` it wo n't do for us to stand here and discuss this where anyone could hear . \\n we 'll head to grethen 's cabin . '' \\n i walked away from them as they followed behind me . \\n my eyes scanned the crowd trying to see if i could catch a glimpse of eris or even the god in the crowd . \\n maybe they would have stayed around to show their face to me . \\n but i knew that if a god was here , he did n't remain long . \\n we reached grethen 's cabin that was hidden in the forest and came to as stop . \\n `` what happened here ? '' \\n dyos said stepping in front of me . \\n i withdrew my demos and stopped him . \\n `` wait . \\n we do n't know if there is someone lurking around here . '' \\n grethen 's once nicely built cabin was now in ruins . \\n there was a big hole in the side of the cabin and the door was crumbled into pieces in front of the entrance . \\n as we peered through the opening we could see the place was completely wrecked . \\n papers , books , and dishes were thrown around the room . \\n someone was in search of something . \\n the sound of someone coming behind us put us all on alert . \\n we turned withdrawing our weapons preparing to fight when the same orc appeared out of the forest . \\n `` i forgot to tell you about your cabin , but it slipped my mind . '' \\n `` who did this ? '' \\n grethen asked . \\n `` eris and that creature did . '' \\n `` i thought you said that they did n't enter the marketplace . '' \\n i said . \\n `` they did n't enter it . \\n they turned to leave and were gone for quite a while to the point that everything went back to normal . \\n but as i was making my way to the meat booth , i heard a crashing sound . \\n me and ariston heard the noise and came to check it out . \\n when we got here we saw eris standing outside the cabin . \\n the creature came out from inside of the cabin . \\n the two exchanged words and then they both teleported away . '' \\n grethen thanked the orc for his information as i stared at the cabin . \\n `` what does this mean aristaeus ? '' \\n dyos questioned . \\n `` it means one of the gods , is a betrayer . '' \\n twenty-five since we could no longer stay at grethen 's house , the orc offered us a place to stay with his family . \\n he introduced himself as bahmel and was over one hundred years old . \\n he was a chatty creature , and often sparked up the conversation among us . \\n we did n't seem to mind since our thoughts were turned to something else anyhow . \\n bahmel , led us to his house that was right behind the marketplace . \\n his cabin was about the same size as grethen 's had been , but where grethen 's had been plain with not a hint of life , bahmel 's was the exact opposite . \\n a colorful red curtain hung in the windows as colorful flowers covered the front lawn . \\n there was a small brown wooden fence around his house that had small shrunken skulls at the top . \\n `` here 's home sweet home . '' \\n bahmel sang . \\n he opened the fence door and held it open for us to come through . \\n entering the yard , bahmel walked over to his front door and opened it . \\n the smells of stew and something sweet wafted in the air . \\n `` gain i 'm home . '' \\n a female orc came around the corner holding a sharp knife . \\n we all tensed expecting trouble . \\n `` not to be alarmed demon bloods , she 's harmless . '' \\n bahmel walked over to his wife and planted a kiss on her cheek . \\n `` gain , we will be having company for tonight . '' \\n `` ah , well come in , i was just preparing dinner and some tarts . '' \\n we entered into the comfortable home and looked around . \\n the living room had more pieces than grethen 's living room , and even a nice lit fireplace . \\n in the corner two small size orcs played with some clay figures that were covered in different color paints . \\n `` does anybody else find this whole scene strange ? '' \\n dyos whispered to us . \\n `` it seems so , mortal . '' \\n i had to agree with dyos on that . \\n i 'd been around mortals long enough and even stalled some time by watching them interact and go about their daily routine . \\n this scene in front of me was so similar to that . \\n it was n't a bad thing -- it was just weird to see such a thing in the world of pearu . \\n `` i take it you demon bloods would like to sit and have your meeting . '' \\n bahmel said . \\n `` if you have somewhere we can converse with each other for a little while , a small room would be fine . '' \\n i said . \\n `` we sure do , follow me . '' \\n bahmel led us down the hall as his wife stared at us with a smile on her face . \\n there was a room on the left side of the hall that bahmel led us too . \\n opening the door , we realized that it was the small orcs room . \\n there were wooden beds on opposites sides of the room , in the middle of the room was a small table that was covered in books , parchment , and coloring pens . \\n bahmel walked over and lit a lantern to brighten up the room a bit more . \\n he also closed the curtains to the window so no one could happen to glance in . \\n `` will this do ? '' \\n `` it 'll be fine . '' \\n i said . \\n dyos and grethen placed their bags down as we stood in the room waiting for bahmel to depart . \\n after a couple of seconds , it seemed he was not leaving . \\n `` bahmel , do you mind giving us a minute ? '' \\n grethen asked . \\n `` oh , but of course . \\n before i leave though , i would like you guys to know . \\n if it 's a battle you 're preparing for , you can count me in . '' \\n we looked at each other and back at bahmel . \\n `` why would you want to join a battle ? '' \\n dyos asked . \\n `` if it 's a battle you want , the king will have one in a couple of days . '' \\n bahmel waved his hand . \\n `` the king is a jester . \\n i 've never liked him . \\n he had good ideas to bring forth some policy in this world , but he 's feeble . \\n that is one thing i liked about eris , she ruled with a strong iron fist . \\n the king would have been better off being a researcher or one of those courant members he loves so dearly . \\n i want to join a battle that will actually bring change . '' \\n `` what do you mean by change ? '' \\n `` i know you hell demons are n't use to a real family . \\n i could tell it by the way you reacted when you entered my home . \\n we seem like mortals do n't we ? '' \\n we shifted around as bahmel continued . \\n `` that 's because we like mortals . '' \\n `` what ? '' \\n dyos said . \\n `` what do you mean like ? '' \\n `` you two might not understand , but grethen and i have been around far longer than you have . \\n we were around when it was okay to enter the mortal world . \\n i do n't know how it was for grethen , but being in the mortal world meant more to me than being there to cause chaos . \\n i loved the way they showcased their emotions and the way they thought . \\n they adored their families , and actually spent time with their children . \\n when have you ever known a blood relation in pearu to actually spend time with their children ? \\n we do n't . \\n we have our spawns and allow them to fend for themselves . \\n i 'm not sorry and i wo n't apologize for the way i feel . \\n i know i 'm not the only one that feels this way as well . \\n there are others in arwid that feel this way , even our prince relates to us , which is why he does n't run off to the city as much . \\n the king would smell it on him . '' \\n `` do not worry bahmel , we will not look down on you . '' \\n i said . \\n dyos shot me a look as to say `` speak for yourself '' . \\n `` what are you asking of us bahmel ? '' \\n grethen said folding his arms . \\n `` why not go to your prince and tell him you want change ? '' \\n `` hey i said the prince could relate to us but i did n't say he was suicidal . \\n he knows not to go up against the king with information like this . \\n but you hell demons are n't like that . \\n i could sense it from the moment you came to my booth this morning . \\n i could hear the love you had for your comrade that had fallen sick . \\n no one in pearu comes to get potions for others unless they are going to sell them . \\n i knew you three were different . \\n you three look set on a mission , and i can tell that you were willing to risk your life for whatever it is you 're planning . \\n when you came back here , you confirmed it . \\n it is then that i decided i would join you . \\n if you could bring changes to pearu , i would follow you into purgatory 's gate myself . '' \\n i did n't have a clue on what to say and it seemed that the others did n't either . \\n giving us a bow of his head , bahmel left out the room closing the door behind him . \\n we stood there in silence for a few moments until grethen spoke . \\n `` we 're on the right course . '' \\n `` what do you mean ? '' \\n i asked . \\n `` samr spoke to me about you . \\n she said you would bring change , and with it you will obtain followers . '' \\n dyos laughed . \\n `` of course my friend will have followers , he has me with him . \\n the question is , will any of these followers be females ? '' \\n grethen laughed as i shook my head . \\n leave it to dyos to lighten up the atmosphere . \\n i sat down on one of the beds . \\n `` we need to figure out how we 're going to do this . \\n we have two battles we have to worry about while trying to remain hidden from my father 's guards . '' \\n `` you 're looking at this wrong aristaeus . '' \\n grethen said . \\n `` you should take bahmel up on his offer . \\n we wo n't be able to handle a battle alone with just the three of us . \\n we can dispatch a few soldiers , but knowing eris , she 's going to have a couple of giants . \\n it 's one of her favorite cards to pull , and you know like i know , the giants take a while to put down . '' \\n `` so what am i supposed to do , head in the marketplace and ask who wants to join me in a battle against the king and the dethroned queen ? \\n i wo n't ask them to risk their lives for me . '' \\n `` this is far bigger than you aristaeus . \\n this world is at stake . \\n we ca n't count on the king 's mindset any longer , and there is no way we will let eris take the throne . \\n it only leaves you . \\n you have to be the one to convince the creatures of pearu to join you . \\n bahmel 's right about the citizens of arwid . \\n they despise both the king and eris . \\n if you give them a reason to join you , they will . '' \\n i nodded as i took in what grethen was saying . \\n it seemed he believe that i could lead our people into salvation . \\n but did he believe because samar said it , or did he truly gain enough from watching me that made him believe . \\n the door opened to the room as gain shuffled in the room . \\n `` i 'm sorry to interrupt you but i have prepared supper . '' \\n dyos was the first one to jump up , followed by grethen . \\n i stayed behind a minute . \\n closing my eyes , i thought about kiowa and whether the potion had worked on her . \\n she 'd been in the window which meant she had enough strength to stand . \\n i convinced myself that after all of this was over -- i would have the chance to see her again . \\n i then thought of the god that had been here . \\n i wanted to speak with astraea about this , but i did n't want to put her in danger . \\n if there was a god helping eris , than he would be listening to see if anything about him would be mentioned . \\n he would definitely be watching astraea and zeus . \\n they 'd been in pearu more than enough times lately . \\n dyos stuck his head through the door . \\n `` are you coming ? \\n i do n't want to be left at the table alone with these creatures . '' \\n `` i 'm coming . '' \\n i got up and followed dyos into the kitchen where the orcs and grethen were seated at the table . \\n i grabbed the seat beside dyos as we sat down . \\n the table was covered with more food than i ever seen . \\n the only time the palace had several dishes on the table was when we were having guests over . \\n the orcs table had two different types of meat , some side vegetables , and some of that unicorn bread that dyos seemed to want . \\n as gain passed me a bowl of carrots , dyos leaned over to whisper in my ear . \\n `` what is it with arwid barters always serving nymph and seaweed tea ? '' \\n i laughed . \\n `` you 're one to talk . \\n your mother is always serving eel . '' \\n `` that is because eel is good and is a prime meat . \\n this is ridiculous . '' \\n `` they have guppy , you like that right ? '' \\n dyos shook his head as if i did n't get it . \\n he was right , i did n't get it . \\n food was food . \\n we finished dinner and surprisingly it was very delicious . \\n the orcs turned out to be great houseguests as they talked with us about their time in the city and the things that they missed in the world of pearu . \\n i believed that bahmel had told his wife what we discussed , because every now and then she would shoot me looks out the corner of her eye . \\n i said nothing to this hoping no one else would pick it up , but of course dyos did . \\n however , he said nothing on the situation either . \\n gain retreated down the hall with her children as we settled down in the living room . \\n i had been right about my father not calling it a night . \\n the sky was still as light as it was this morning when i 'd gotten up . \\n the whole thing irritated me . \\n i know he wanted me in his custody , but he could have at least showed some consideration to kiowa in her state or at least for the citizens . \\n `` so , have you made a decision on whether i could join you on your journey ? '' \\n `` what about your wife bahmel ? '' \\n i asked . \\n `` would n't she be worried that you 're leaving her behind ? '' \\n `` gain understands that in order to bring change , there will have to be certain sacrifices . '' \\n `` well welcome aboard bahmel . '' \\n grethen said shaking the orcs hand . \\n we filled bahmel on everything making sure to keep samr out of it . \\n he remained quiet throughout it all only mumbling sounds of agreement here and there . \\n i even told him who i was . \\n he seemed to be shock to see the king 's son in his home . \\n he seemed even more shock that the king had banned me from pearu just because i would not fight with him in the battle against the gods . \\n `` what is the king thinking ? \\n does he realize the gods have power that we can not even imagine ? \\n i hate bowing down to them just as much as he does , but i know not to go up against one of them . '' \\n i opened my mouth to reply to him when a knock sounded at the door . \\n we all tensed as i grabbed my demos . \\n `` where you expecting company ? '' \\n i asked bahmel . \\n bahmel shook his head . \\n `` no . \\n but since it 's still light out , maybe it 's someone from the market . '' \\n bahmel got up to get the door as we moved out of view of it . \\n bahmel gave us another glance before pulling open the door . \\n ` who are you ? '' \\n `` i come to speak with aristaeus . '' \\n at the sound of the voice , i moved from my spot behind the wall . \\n i came into the hall and stared at the creature in the doorway . \\n `` os ' mar. '' os ' mar smiled as i made my way towards him . \\n i grabbed my old friend into a hug more than happy to see him . \\n pulling back , i took a good look at him . \\n he looked no different than when i 'd saw him last in belham . \\n i turned to bahmel . \\n `` this is a friend of mine , may he come in . '' \\n `` of course '' bahmel stepped to the side to allow os ' mar to enter . \\n os ' mar thanked the orc as he entered . \\n dyos and grethen came from their hiding spots and gave os ' mar curious glances . \\n `` where have you been ? \\n did the gods release you ? '' \\n i asked him . \\n `` i was never captured aristaeus . \\n they only took me in because there was nowhere else i could go . \\n belham was destroyed and there was no way the king was going to allow me to enter pearu without trying to kill me . '' \\n `` so you had to stay with the gods ? '' \\n dyos asked . \\n `` it was n't all bad . \\n they allowed me to work . \\n their world is very beautiful . \\n i wish i could talk more about it , but they put a gag on me . \\n it 's understandable . \\n they do n't want any enemies getting any bright ideas . '' \\n `` what kind of work did they have you doing ? '' \\n `` when i first got there , they wanted me to help them locate the souls that were stolen . \\n they were on my radar for a while , but then like lights being turned off , they disappeared from sight . \\n it was strange too , i was almost sure i 'd pinpoint the location . '' \\n `` i 'm sure it was n't a coincidence that they suddenly blinked out . '' \\n i said exchanging glances with others . \\n `` well i 'm happy you 're okay my friend . \\n i was worried about you . '' \\n `` no need to worry . \\n i am fine . \\n i 'm better than fine actually . '' \\n i introduced os ' mar to the others as they gathered around him welcoming him to our troop . \\n gain came out the back room to check on us . \\n at the sight of the new comrade , she rushed to the kitchen to retrieve leftovers . \\n os ' mar happily took the left overs , making sure to compliment gain on her cooking . \\n i stood in the corner staring at the scene as dyos made his way over to me . \\n `` well at least some good came out of it . \\n the gods release your friend . '' \\n `` i 'm not so sure about that '' dyos stared at me confused . \\n `` what do you mean ? '' \\n `` that is not os ' mar. '' dyos stared at me and turned to stare at os ' mar. . \\n i had been so happy to see my old friend that i 'd forgotten what i 'd secretly learned about him . \\n i stared at the creature pretending to be os ' mar. . \\n he glanced over at me and smiled as i gave a fake smile of mine . \\n the night astraea came to see me , flashed in my mind . \\n astraea was getting ready to head back home . \\n dyos being the good friend had given us some privacy . \\n it was then that i asked her about os ' mar. . \\n closing my eyes , her words rang in my ear . \\n `` aristaeus , os ' mar is dead . '' \\n opening my eyes , i studied the creature . \\n i would find out what happen to os ' mar , and find out who exactly , this creature was . \\n twenty-six night finally came in pearu giving the citizens a chance to rest from the long day . \\n gain got the children ready for bed . \\n dyos and i stood on the wall watching grethen and bahmel converse with os ' mar. . \\n staring at os ' mar i tried to figure out whom exactly was controlling this creature that was pretending to be os ' mar. . \\n my mind had already convinced me it was lilith , but there were other players who could have taken him . \\n i thought about my father and the prisoner on the side of the cell when i 'd been captured . \\n i had thought it to be just one of the other citizens , but now that i think about it , why would my father hold an arrested citizen in the palace . \\n it could have been os ' mar 's body he was holding hostage . \\n my father had been practicing spells lately . \\n maybe he 'd learn how to take control of a creature 's body . \\n i would n't past him . \\n i then thought about the third player in the game . \\n the god . \\n i could n't remember seeing os ' mar the day the gods came into belham . \\n he could have still been alive , and could have been one of the ones who fled . \\n maybe one of the gods that came , had chased him and killed him . \\n he was the keeper of souls , and since the god was working with eris , he could have needed some information from him . \\n but os ' mar was n't the type to run from the gods . \\n he worked for them , so why run ? \\n grethen got up from his seat and made his way over to us . \\n he sipped something from his clay mug as he stood beside me , his body facing the wall , his back to bahmel and os ' mar. `` there is something off about your friend . '' \\n `` you 've picked up on it as well . '' \\n grethen nodded . \\n `` there 's a humming sound coming from him . \\n he also keep shifting and glancing over at you every few minutes . \\n at first i thought because he did not know us well and you were the only one he was comfortable with . \\n but the glances he is throwing you are n't friendly , they 're sinister . '' \\n `` so how do you want to handle him ? '' \\n dyos asked . \\n `` give me a moment alone with him . '' \\n dyos and grethen nodded . \\n they walked over to bahmel and os ' mar as dyos clapped a hand on bahmel 's shoulder . \\n `` say bahmel , you got any more of that seaweed drink ? '' \\n bahmel headed to the kitchen to fix dyos a drink as he and grethen followed , leaving me alone with os ' mar. `` i tell ya aristaeus , it sure is good to be back in pearu . \\n i almost forgot how great the air smells here . '' \\n i chuckled . \\n `` why do n't we go outside and get some of that fresh air ? '' \\n `` um , sure . '' \\n i led the way out the door as os ' mar followed . \\n my hand gripped my demos as i led him a few feet away from bahmel 's home . \\n i did n't want to jeopardize waking his children or attract any attention from the neighborhood barters . \\n we walked into the forest as the sound of night creatures traveled through the green haven . \\n the moment i got deep into the forest , i turned to face os ' mar with my weapon drawn . \\n he seemed to be ready for some sort of attack as his face changed . \\n his true face emerged revealing his true nature . \\n he was a cyclops . \\n i did n't give him a chance to get a hold on me as i slashed away at him . \\n the cyclops dodged my demos and sent a punch at me . \\n the punch landed at the tip of my jaw as my teeth clamped down on my tongue bringing blood into my mouth . \\n i wiped my mouth filled with anger . \\n i wanted to subdue the creature not kill him . \\n however , if it came to me or him , it was going to be him . \\n i threw my jugest in his direction catching him around the leg . \\n i yanked as his feet were pulled from under him . \\n he fell to the ground in a heap as i sent fire through the ropes of the jugest . \\n he hollered as sat down on top of him , holding him into place . \\n i kept one hand on my jugest sending heat through the rope to keep him at ease . \\n footsteps sounded ahead of me as dyos , grethen , and bahmel stepped into the clearing . \\n `` you 've captured him '' bahmel said with surprise . \\n grethen stared down at the creature . \\n `` cyclops , definitely one of eris flunkies . \\n did you get anything out of him yet ? '' \\n `` not yet . '' \\n i turned to the cyclops and placed the blade of my demos at his throat . \\n `` identify yourself cyclops . '' \\n `` i do not answer to the likes of you puny prince . '' \\n i pressed the blade deeper into his throat striking blood . \\n the cyclops moaned in pain as he tried to shake me off of him . \\n he was only causing himself more harm by moving . \\n every time he moved , he ended up brushing up against the rope burning himself . \\n `` let 's try this again , who are you ? '' \\n `` pathos . '' \\n `` who sent you here pathos ? '' \\n the cyclops glanced at me like he was about to rebel again , but after an arch of my brow , he reconsidered . \\n `` no one sent me , i came on my own . '' \\n `` ah , and why is that ? '' \\n `` i heard the king had banned his son , i wanted to see for myself . '' \\n `` he 's lying . '' \\n dyos said staring down at him . \\n he placed the heel of his boot on the pathoss hand and pressed down . \\n `` alright ! '' \\n he screamed . \\n `` the courant sent me . '' \\n `` the courant ? '' \\n `` yes the courant . \\n they captured me a while back and were holding me as leverage to get eris to show her face . \\n it was becoming clear that eris would not show herself , even for a bottom feeder like me . \\n she left me to rot at the hands of the king , so i betrayed her . '' \\n `` you creatures and your betrayal . '' \\n grethen said shaking his head . \\n i ignored his comment . \\n `` why did they let you go ? '' \\n `` they let me go to find you . \\n they had a feeling that you would try to stop them from going to war with the gods , or better yet tell them their plans . '' \\n there was a gleam in the cyclops eye as he relayed this information . \\n `` you 've been caught prince , they know that you and your friend over here found out about the maps for the battle . \\n the king has banned your little friend as well . \\n you 're both enemies to the king and pearu . '' \\n `` what about the general ? '' \\n dyos said stepping forward . \\n `` dead . '' \\n pathos smiled . \\n i turned to stare at dyos as the news hit him of his father 's death . \\n letting out a growl of rage , he ran forward towards the pathos as grethen grabbed his arms , holding him into a lock . \\n dyos wrestled against him as bahmel joined to hold dyos back . \\n grethen whispered something in dyos ear as he began to pull him back from pathos . \\n i wanted to go and comfort my friend , but i knew i had to finish getting answers from the cyclops . \\n turning back to face the pathos , he still held that smile on his face as he watch dyos battle with the loss of his father . \\n i punched him in the mouth knocking the smile off his face . \\n the cyclops shook away the dizziness of my punch and turned to glare at me . \\n `` why did the king kill his general ? '' \\n `` why do you think ? \\n if he could n't govern simple information how could he lead an army of soldiers to the gates tonight ? '' \\n i stared at the cyclops as if i did not hear him right . \\n `` what do you mean tonight ? \\n the king is going to war tonight ? '' \\n the cyclops simply smiled up at me with blood coating his teeth . \\n loud booms sounded in the air as i turned my attention to the sky . \\n smoke was in the air as a horn blew through the land . \\n i turned to stare at dyos who 'd stopped struggling against grethen and bahmel at the sound of the booms . \\n they glanced towards the sky and over at me . \\n `` it 's started . \\n the war between us and the gods have started ! '' \\n they ran over to me as i lifted off of pathos and walked over to them . \\n `` we have no time . \\n we have to get to the marketplace and gather as many creatures as we can to fight . \\n we do n't have time for long speeches to convince them . \\n we have to hurry . '' \\n dyos turned to grethen . \\n `` i thought you said the plague would arrive in three days . '' \\n grethen looked just as confused . \\n `` something 's not right . '' \\n `` your precious samr has tricked us ! '' \\n dyos shouted . \\n a light flash in the sky as it touched the ground near me . \\n we turned to face the light as it cleared revealing astraea . \\n `` a god ! '' \\n bahmel shouted removing his weapon . \\n `` touch her and die ! '' \\n bahmel turned to me and stared in confusion . \\n he put his sword away as dyos touched him on the shoulder and shook his head . \\n i walked over to astraea as she pulled me into a hug . \\n i pulled back and stared at her . \\n `` what are you doing here ? '' \\n `` our world is preparing for battle . \\n i 'm worried aristaeus , my father has called for the archangels as well . \\n the archangels never come out to fight a war with the gods . \\n i think the plague is coming tonight . '' \\n `` it does n't matter . '' \\n i assured her . \\n `` we will be ready . '' \\n there were voices outside of the forest as creatures came out to see what was going on . \\n it was night so there was no way anyone should have been up . \\n i also found it strange that a war was going on when it was considered night in pearu . \\n my father should have been sleep -- the sky was proof of this . \\n astraea seemed to read my thoughts because she said , `` aristaeus , i think your father has found a way to move about throughout the night without being sleep . '' \\n `` i have to get to the palace . \\n i have to get kiowa somewhere safe . '' \\n the cyclops laughed behind me as i turned to face him . \\n he stared at me as he grinned brightly . \\n `` you 're a little late on that as well prince . \\n your queen is dead . '' \\n i froze in place as i pointed my demos at him . \\n `` you lie ! '' \\n `` i do no such thing . \\n the queen died the moment you left the palace . \\n the king buried her today . \\n such a shame you could n't have been there to say goodbye . '' \\n astraea placed a hand on my shoulder as i stared at the creature on the ground . \\n i wanted what he was saying to be a lie , but his eyes showed the truth . \\n the queen was dead . \\n kiowa , my mother , was dead . \\n i did n't even get a chance to say goodbye . \\n growling with rage and pain , my true face pushed its way forward . \\n lifting my demos in the air , i removed the laughing cyclops head from his body , as it rolled into the trees . \\n falling to my knees , my body shook with sobs , as i stared up at the smoky purple sky . \\n twenty-seven `` aristaeus , are you okay ? '' \\n i turned to face astraea as she approached me . \\n after learning of my mother 's death , i retreated away to be alone . \\n my face was soaked with tears as i tried to come to terms with my mother 's death . \\n astraea stood behind me hesitantly on whether or not i would welcome her . \\n dyos and the others stood a few feet away throwing me concerned glances . \\n i turned from facing them and stared through the trees , my hands folded . \\n i rubbed my white moonstone ring . \\n `` it 's my fault . '' \\n i mumbled . \\n `` i should n't have left her behind . '' \\n `` aristaeus you had no choice but to leave . '' \\n `` i could have fought harder . \\n i should have fought harder to make my father see . \\n i could have still been there with her . '' \\n `` your mother would n't want you to suffer this way aristaeus . '' \\n astraea wrapped her arms around me and hugged my neck . \\n `` the best way to honor her memory is remember how much she loved you and how much she believed in what you were doing . \\n your mother loved you right to the end despite what you were and the unknown plans the world had for you . \\n she would n't want you to give up on your mission . \\n do n't give lilith and your father the satisfaction of seeing you down . '' \\n i turned to stare at astraea . \\n she was right . \\n my mother was gone . \\n there was nothing i could do about it . \\n there was hurt in my chest from the loss of her , but the only replace that feeling was to adapt another emotion . \\n i pecked astraea 's hand and stood up from the log i 'd been sitting on . \\n `` you should be getting back to your people . \\n they are going to need you in battle . '' \\n `` no , i 'm fighting with you . \\n we 're in all of this together . '' \\n i smiled at her , happy she was willing to go to war with me . \\n but i could n't let her fight with me . \\n `` go astraea , your father will need you at his side . \\n you have his bolts remember . \\n you take care of things on that side . \\n we 'll take care of things on this side . '' \\n `` but . '' \\n `` no buts . \\n go . '' \\n astraea looked at me to make sure this was what i wanted . \\n leaning over , she placed a kiss on my lips . \\n `` i love you . '' \\n `` i love you as well . \\n always . '' \\n stepping back , astraea look towards the sky as a light shot down and she disappeared . \\n i walked over to the group as they walked over to meet me . \\n `` are you okay ? '' \\n dyos asked me . \\n `` i 'll be fine , as will you . '' \\n `` what are the orders your majesty ? '' \\n grethen said . \\n i looked at the three creatures in front of me and realized i was their leader . \\n i was n't king yet , but they were already ready to follow me into the unknown . \\n `` we gather as many creatures as we can , and then , we take back our world . '' \\n we left the forest and made our way back to the marketplace village . \\n creatures stood in groups pointing towards the sky as the sound of booms could be heard all throughout the world of pearu . \\n at our entrance they turned to face us their eyes filled with alarm . \\n the male creatures stood in front of their women , weapons drawn . \\n one creature stepped forward a battle axe in his hand . \\n `` bahmel , what are you doing over there with those hell demons ? \\n i hear they 're causing a war up there in the city , do not get mix up with them . '' \\n `` do not fear . '' \\n bahmel said stepping forward . \\n `` they bring us no harm . '' \\n `` ha ! '' \\n another creature yelled . \\n `` that 's all the hell demons bring , is harm . \\n you get over here right now and help defend our land . '' \\n `` i 'm sorry brothers , but i have taken up with these hell demons . '' \\n `` then you are a traitor ! '' \\n bahmel and the crowd began to argue back and forth as he tried to convince them that he was not a traitor . \\n even dyos , tried to make a plea to them , but they had nothing to say to one of their favorite hell demons . \\n grethen said nothing . \\n while he 'd taken up residence in this town , he did not communicate much with them so he had no pull . \\n i stepped forward and held up my hand as the crowd turned to me and quieted down . \\n `` i am aristaeus priam , prince of pearu . '' \\n `` not anymore ! '' \\n shouted someone in the crowd as they began to cackle . \\n `` do not talk to your future king like that you rascals ! '' \\n dyos said jumping forward pointing his sword at them . \\n `` silence dyos . '' \\n i said sweeping him back . \\n `` you are right . \\n i have been banned from pearu by the king , my father . \\n these two demons beside me have also been banned from this world , but it is not for the reason that you think or that they might have written on the wanted posters . \\n the king , the courant , and your prince , are right now at the gates of our world , about to go to war with the gods . '' \\n gasps sounded throughout the crowd as creatures turned to whisper to each other . \\n `` what are you talking about ? ' \\n `` did the gods come on our land ? '' \\n `` did they attack us first ? '' \\n questions started to pour in from different creatures as they began to over talk each other . \\n `` the king has decided that he will no longer bow down to the gods . \\n it 's not because he wants to stand up for his world , or that he feels that we are being treated unfair . \\n the king has a vendetta towards the king of gods that he has been holding onto for centuries . \\n he has decided that this vendetta is worth the lives of you and your families , and it is worth the destruction of our world . '' \\n `` what is the vendetta ? '' \\n asked the creature from earlier . \\n i stared at the crowd as i revealed the secret i read in my father 's journal . \\n `` the king wishes to destroy zeus , because of the death of his family . \\n but zeus is not to blame . \\n eris , your dethroned queen , is the reason why the king 's parents are dead . \\n eris has fooled us by thinking that she is only after the throne and that she cares for our world . \\n the truth is , eris plans to unleash a plague that will destroy our world if we do not stop her . '' \\n `` a plague ? '' \\n `` you lie ! '' \\n `` what do we do ? '' \\n `` he does not lie ! '' \\n bahmel said . \\n `` i 've seen this plague . '' \\n my eyes turned to look at bahmel . \\n bahmel gave me a look that said to trust him . \\n i glanced over at dyos and grethen as we waited for what bahmel would say . \\n `` when aristaeus told me of this plague , i did not believe him myself . \\n i thought he was crazy and that all the city air had gotten to him . \\n you know how the air has those city demons acting . '' \\n the creatures laughed in agreement with bahmel . \\n maybe he was on to something . \\n he stepped forward closer to them . \\n `` i was ready to put him and his buddies out of my house when he mentioned the cosmic orb . '' \\n `` cosmic orb ? '' \\n `` what is that ? '' \\n `` is that some type of moonstone ? '' \\n `` many of you do not know about the cosmic orb because you were not around when the gates were open to us . \\n i discovered the mention of this cosmic orb in the mortal world in one of their books . \\n at first i thought it to be a myth , until when i went back the next day the pages about the orb was ripped from the book . \\n an angel approached me and warned me to keep my mouth shut about what i 'd read . \\n you know me , i was ready to tell this wing fellow where he could stick it , but he did something to me , to the point that i forgot about it . \\n it is only when aristaeus mentioned it -- did i remember what happened that day ? \\n that is how i know he speaks the truth about the plague . \\n eris has it , and we 've learned anything from our experience of having to serve someone like her , that she does not mean any good . '' \\n bahmel retreated back over to us as the creatures talked amongst themselves trying to decide on whether or not they believed us or not . \\n `` you 've never seen the cosmic orb . \\n why did you lie to them ? '' \\n i said keeping my eye on the crowd . \\n `` it is the only way they would consider to follow you prince . \\n these creatures do n't like to get involve in matters unless it pertains to them . '' \\n `` where did you get that story ? \\n i almost believed it myself . '' \\n dyos chuckled . \\n bahmel beamed at dyos . \\n `` it 's some words i took out of a novel i 'm writing . \\n i just happened to switch some things around . \\n aristaeus is much like the character i 'm writing about which was how i knew that this speech would work on my neighbors . '' \\n `` smart . '' \\n grethen said smiling . \\n i agreed . \\n we only had to hope that it would work . \\n the crowd split as they turned to face us . \\n `` we 've considered what you said , and you 're right . \\n but why should we trust the prince . \\n how do we know he will be able to defeat eris ? '' \\n i handed my demos to dyos and took a step forward . \\n removing my blazer , i stood in front of the crowd . \\n it was time . \\n i thought long and hard during my time alone on what course i would take . \\n would i remain faithful to those i was raised to serve , or would i change course and serve with someone new . \\n closing my eyes , i whispered in my head . \\n `` i accept to be a sacrilege . '' \\n there was a slight calm in my head and then samr spoke , `` you are ready , aristaeus . '' \\n a heat went through me as i heard the gasps all around me . \\n the gasps came from the crowd and from my friends behind me . \\n opening my eyes i stared through my eyes as my eyes caught a reflection of me in one of the creature 's eyes . \\n huge white wings spread from my back as they reached towards the sky , the tip of the feathers a royal blue . \\n `` any questions . '' \\n the creatures shook their heads as they stared at me in awe . \\n `` now , where is lilith . '' \\n twenty-eight after seeing my wings , the creatures pointed out the last direction they 'd known lilith to be in . \\n many claim to have spotted her headed towards the city while others have said that she was headed to mayur . \\n there was a lot of confusion as the groups began to fuss about who was right and who was wrong . \\n it took us a while to get them under control . \\n we finally decided our best bet was to make our way to the city . \\n if lilith wanted to cause a scene , she would to do it while the creatures of pearu were in a fight with the gods . \\n we left arwid with a group of soldiers that was ready to help us fight . \\n others stayed behind shouting things that we were on a fool 's mission and its best that we not get involved with the elite affairs . \\n the journey from arwid to the city was a tense one . \\n you could feel the rumble of anticipation rolling off the soldiers . \\n some of the soldiers did n't have any family to leave behind so they had no problems joining us . \\n however , there were a few who kept glancing back at their neighborhood as it disappeared from view , as if they would never get a chance to see it again . \\n i felt terrible that i was pulling them away from their families , but if they wanted their families to be able to live safely , this could not go on any longer . \\n the minute our boots touched city limits , our weapons were drawn . \\n arriving in the city , it was easy to detect the smell of fire and smoke . \\n the carriage cabin was empty of its owner and i took it to mean that he 'd gone to join the battle . \\n my father was gathering anyone it seemed in order to fill his vendetta . \\n we exited the forest and the made our way down the curve road . \\n there was nothing else left to shield us from the view of the guards or any citizens . \\n as we got further down the road it seemed clear that no one would be on the lookout for us . \\n the clanging of metal sounded in the night air along with growls , screams , and explosive booms . \\n we were close to the fight . \\n coming upon the end of the street , i squatted low to the ground and waved my hand for everybody to lower as well . \\n peering from behind the wall of a building , i stared at the streets that were littered with debris . \\n there were two creature bodies that lay dead on the ground , their bodies covered in slashes , their heads cleanly removed . \\n `` this is it . '' \\n dyos whispered . \\n `` the day our lives change forever . '' \\n dyos was right . \\n today we would either make history by stopping both the king and eris or we would make history by being the ones who let the world of pearu be destroyed . \\n turning around to face the creatures behind me , i asked . \\n `` are you guys ready ? '' \\n they nodded with excitement riddled on their faces . \\n it was now or never . \\n stepping out from behind the wall , i walked into the streets . \\n there was no one in the direction to the right . \\n buildings appeared to be deserted . \\n the only sign of life inside them was the moving of the curtains in the window . \\n as i turned left , i felt my eyes widened at the sight before me . \\n it was like a nightmare . \\n there were creatures everywhere . \\n they swung their swords with fierceness at their opponents , the gods . \\n the gods stood tall , their armor gleaming despite the fiery smoke in the air . \\n their movements were somewhat dancelike . \\n there footwork showed that they was not in a hurry and could easily dispatch their opponent if they wanted to . \\n they swung their weapons that slashed through the creatures of damned , freezing them before slicing them in half . \\n up ahead i saw astraea as she battled a minotaur . \\n she did n't seem to be having any trouble as she swiftly got rid of the annoying beast . \\n i watched her rip a bolt off her bracelet before tossing it to zeus who stood behind her . \\n zeus caught the bolt without looking back and threw it at the creature that was running towards him . \\n one of my father 's soldiers turned and saw us waiting in the street . \\n `` it 's aristaeus ! '' \\n at the sound of my name , many of the creatures rushed towards us , feeling that they would rather handles us than that of the gods . \\n some of them were n't so lucky to get to us , as the gods had cornered them from running towards us . \\n a demon ran at me as i ran forward to meet him . \\n i gave my demos one quick swish as it stopped the running demon mid-way . \\n my soldiers rushed past me as they grabbed their own opponents . \\n the guards did n't seem to be much to handle . \\n they 're footwork was sloppy and so where there hand movements . \\n because i had been banned , they had no one to really guide them on how to properly fight us . \\n it would be an easy win for us . \\n two more guards ran towards me as i dodged one of their blades and kicked the other in the stomach . \\n the guard i kicked flew a few feet away as i took care of his friend . \\n the guard swung his battle axe wildly , slightly nipping me on the arm . \\n the cut stung for a second before i felt it healing . \\n the guard glanced at my arm in surprise as i gave a smirk . \\n he did n't know that i could heal myself now . \\n while he was distracted by my healed wound , my blade glided across his throat finishing him . \\n the other guard that i 'd kicked , had snuck up on me . \\n his arms circled me as he tried to wrestle my demos to the ground . \\n the claw of my jugest dug into my shoulder as the demon pushed against my back . \\n deciding to play dirty , i stepped on his foot as he screamed out . \\n i further made the pain worst by stabbing his foot with my blade . \\n it was enough to get him to back up off of me . \\n the guard hobbled back grabbing his injured foot . \\n dyos , who had just finished killing off his own opponent , swung his knife in my opponent 's back knocking him down . \\n `` have you seen her yet ? '' \\n he asked . \\n `` not yet . '' \\n lilith and eris still had n't shown their faces . \\n i wondered for a second if we 'd gotten it wrong . \\n maybe the plague really was coming in three days . \\n by that time we would be vulnerable . \\n they had to know like i did that we would not last with a fight against the gods . \\n maybe they were counting on the gods to take care of the majority of us so lilith would n't have to . \\n that could have been why she was speaking with a god . \\n i snapped out of my slight distraction and jumped back into the battle . \\n i had made my way from the middle of the street now up to the front of the street . \\n as i maneuvered through the battle , i noticed the tons of bodies that had begun to pile up . \\n i did n't want to even imagine how many of my kind had already been killed . \\n i got rid of a couple more guards when i noticed my father . \\n he stood within the fray dressed completely in his battle gear . \\n his eyes were on zeus whose attention was on the hydra he was fighting . \\n my father made his way towards zeus , his hands glowing with strange orange electricity . \\n he 'd done it . \\n he 'd somehow mastered some kind of power that resembled the light that lilith often shot out of her hands . \\n astraea seemed to notice him moving towards her father at the same time that i did . \\n she jumped in front of her father 's back prepared to defend him . \\n my father 's eyes narrowed in anger . \\n he did n't like astraea just as much as he did n't like zeus . \\n his hands shook as he prepared to send the ball of light towards her . \\n i did n't dare hesitate . \\n i ran with demon speed slashing creatures out of my way . \\n astraea stared at my father , her weapon drawn . \\n she did n't want to hurt him , but she would not allow him to hurt her father . \\n my father released a growl of anger as he shot the ball out of his lands . \\n i landed just in time to block the ball with my sword as it bounced off . \\n the ball collided with the back of one of the gods as he his mouth opened in a silent scream . \\n a burst of light appeared around him , and then he disappeared . \\n `` dionysus ! '' \\n astraea cried . \\n my father stared at me blocking astraea as a look of disgust rose to his face . \\n `` so i 've guess you finally have chosen a side . '' \\n `` you left me no choice father , you banned me . '' \\n `` you betrayed me ! '' \\n he yelled out . \\n his weapon came out as he ran at me . \\n i pushed astraea to the side as i blocked my father 's hits . \\n the two of us danced around with our weapons , the metal clanging against each other . \\n i did n't want to hurt my father despite the anger i had towards him . \\n he was still my father , and i loved him . \\n my father swung his sword at my head as i lifted mine up to block it . \\n `` father , you must call off this madness . \\n ca n't you see you 're losing ? '' \\n `` shut up ! '' \\n `` no ! \\n i 've shut up for a long time and allowed you to run the country however you wanted to . \\n well no more . \\n i wo n't let you turn our world into ash because of your vendetta . '' \\n `` you do not understand my vendetta . '' \\n `` your vendetta killed kiowa ! '' \\n i yelled . \\n my father took a step back and looked at me . \\n he was n't as unaffected as he liked to make himself out to be . \\n the death of his wife had shaken him to the point that he actually looked as if he was on a verge of breakdown . \\n `` father , please just call this off . \\n she would n't want you to do this . '' \\n i tried to plead for my father to see reason . \\n as i hope for a second that he would , it slowly diminished . \\n my father 's face changed back into his usual face of composure as he stared coldly at me . \\n `` the queen would want me to stay my course and teach you a lesson . \\n it 's time that you remembered who you are ? '' \\n my father face began to change as his body shook with trembles . \\n i stared at him in horror as i he called forth another power . \\n whatever the power was , it was taking a lot out of him . \\n he looked as if he was about to kill over the way he shook and paled . \\n the use of such a strong power had caught zeus 's attention as he turned to face my father . \\n his face was filled with alarm as he pointed his staff at him . \\n it was quite clear that he was about to control my father when the sound of huge booms sounded in the air . \\n these booms were different than those of the ones from the god 's weapons . \\n these booms shook the ground as we all fought for balance . \\n turning to the left , we watched as two giants ran towards us . \\n they were followed by a group of creatures that were dressed for battle . \\n in the middle of them , riding on a chariot , was lilith . \\n lilith 's attention was enough to snap my father out of calling the death striking power . \\n instead he faced eris as the orange glow return . \\n the ball shot out of his hands and headed towards her . \\n the witch smiled as the ball neared her . \\n leaping up , she caught the ball and hurled it back in our direction . \\n the ball moved so fast before our eyes , that we had no time to block . \\n a groan came from behind me as i turned around . \\n my father lay on the ground . \\n his body shook two times ... and then he was dead . \\n twenty-nine my eyes stared at my father 's body , his youthful face now pale , and his scattered eyes gone of purple . \\n thunder boomed in the sky as flashes of light appeared every few seconds . \\n the sky began to change from purple to a bright red . \\n the world of pearu had a new ruler , and it was n't me . \\n staring across the battle , my eyes landed on lilith . \\n her head was tilted up towards the sky . \\n feeling my eyes upon hers , she dropped her head and stared at me with red eyes . \\n she 'd killed my mother , and now she was set on destroying my world . \\n she would not be leaving here alive . \\n `` aristaeus no ! '' \\n zeus voice shouted behind me , but it was too late . \\n i ran for lilith with speed as i lunged myself up from the ground . \\n i dodged the bat of a giant as i flew over his head towards lilith who waited patiently for me in her chariot . \\n i raised my demos in the air and brought it down towards her . \\n i did n't even get a chance to touch her . \\n she gave a wave of her hand , as i flew over her and onto the ground behind her . \\n i landed on the ground with a thud , my blade going through my thigh . \\n `` ahh ! '' \\n i screamed out . \\n i pulled the blade from my leg as blood dripped down it . \\n i pull myself to a stand , the muscles in my leg tightening as they reattached . \\n my moonstone ring lit up as my hand was tugged in front of me . \\n a hell hound appeared before my face as it lunged at me knocking me down on the ground . \\n i brought my hands up blocking the teeth of the hound as it tried to nip at my face . \\n my head swirled around on the ground as my eyes latched onto lilith . \\n she 'd gotten off her chariot and was now walking amongst the battle . \\n creatures ran at her from both sides trying to get a hold of her , but she simply knocked them away as she did me . \\n i turned my focus back on the dog , its eyes red the same color as its master . \\n just the sight of that red color was enough to make me snap . \\n reaching around the hound 's neck , i gave it a quick snap before tossing it to the side . \\n two more followed as i kicked one over in grethen 's direction and i sliced the other 's head off . \\n while i had been busy with the hounds , zeus and lilith were locked in a battle . \\n zeus seemed to have the upper hand as he knocked her around . \\n i got up and made my way towards them when my attention turned to one of the gods . \\n the god approached zeus with an evil look on his face . \\n he held a golden staff as he brushed aside any creatures that got in his way . \\n i turned to see where astraea was located . \\n she was off on the far side with poseidon double teaming a giant . \\n zeus had no one to cover his back . \\n he was left wide open . \\n putting my demos away , i called forth my own power . \\n i followed the same steps i did when i was in my bedroom at the palace . \\n i felt the heat in my hand as the white ball began to form in my hand growing larger and large . \\n this time as i released it , i had more control over it . \\n the ball zoomed smoothly through the air as creatures got out of its way . \\n zeus , lilith , or the god did n't seem to take notice of the light . \\n the ball reached closer to them as the god stepped directly in its path . \\n the ball hit the god , his staff falling out of his hands . \\n he dropped to the ground on his knees as the other gods turned to stare at him . \\n they glanced from him to me automatically assuming i 'd taken out one of theirs without proper cause . \\n they rushed at me as i prepared myself for battle . \\n astraea landed in front of me guarding me the same way i 'd done her . \\n `` stop it ! \\n you ca n't kill him . '' \\n `` he killed apollo ! '' \\n shouted a female god . \\n apollo . \\n i 'd killed the god that had banished samr from their world . \\n was this fate or the creator 's way of punishing him ? \\n `` apollo was about to attack your king . '' \\n i said . \\n `` i saved his life . '' \\n the god reached to grab me as astraea blocked her pushing her back . \\n `` i wo n't let you harm him . \\n any of you ! '' \\n the gods stared at astraea as if they could n't believe she was choosing me over them . \\n i knew the look too well because it was the same look my father and the rest of the elite gave me . \\n the female god opened her mouth to give a retort when the ground began to shake . \\n a cold chill began to sweep the air as wind picked up . \\n debris flew in the air as the wind whipped away anything in its reach harshly . \\n `` what 's going on ? '' \\n astraea asked glancing around . \\n the other gods did n't seem to have an answer either as they tried to figure it out as well . \\n i took in the scene as everything began to slow down for me . \\n the cold chill , the harsh wind , the reddening of the sky , these things were unfamiliar with the death of a king . \\n there have never been a death of royalty in pearu , but i was quite certain these things did not come along with it . \\n this was something different . \\n this was the plague . \\n `` it 's eris . '' \\n i shouted . \\n `` she 's released the plague . '' \\n the wind picked up even more roughly as small clearing appeared in the sky . \\n one by one the gods were ripped from the ground and pulled back up to the sky . \\n zeus went to go grab lilith , but the wind caught him pulling him up as well . \\n i was not going to let her get away . \\n my boots flew across the ground as i felt my new strength taking over me . \\n using a falling giant for a boost , i leaped into the air , my demos raised high . \\n lilith turned around , her eyes wide with fear . \\n i 'd caught her by surprise . \\n there was nowhere for her to run . \\n time seem to slow as i neared her . \\n our eyes connected for a slight moment , and then she was no more . \\n i landed on the ground as lilith 's head rolled to the side . \\n it was done . \\n lilith was dead . \\n `` aristaeus ! \\n i turned around to see astraea struggling to keep her balance . \\n the wind had caught her legs and was about to pull her up . \\n i ran over and grabbed onto her hand as i felt myself being drug across the ground . \\n dyos and grethen made their way over to me and grabbed onto my body as we all tried to keep astraea from being pulled away . \\n the wind picked up as dirt and debris flew around . \\n out the corner of my eyes i saw a shadowy figure making its way towards us . \\n a blue ball rested in front of it as the figure neared us . \\n the force of the wind pulled again , yanking astraea higher . \\n with one final tug , it yanked her along with us as we all were pulled towards the sky . \\n i stared down at shadowy figure that seemed to be getting smaller and smaller . \\n the world of pearu began to blow past us fast as we were pulled towards the sky . \\n the world of pearu darkened with each passing second of the plague . \\n there was a moment where everything froze , and then we were gone . \\n epilogue a blur of colors whirled around us as our screams seemed to encase us . \\n we 'd found ourselves in a world of tornado as different images flew past us . \\n the spinning got faster and then stopped dropping us . \\n we fell from a distance , our hands no longer attached . \\n one by one our bodies collided with the ground . \\n `` ow . '' \\n dyos cried . \\n `` where are we ? '' \\n i pushed up from the ground and turned to see dyos and grethen . \\n i did n't see astraea . \\n filled with fear , i turned behind me and spotted her . \\n i sighed with relief . \\n `` you 're okay . '' \\n astraea did not reply . \\n `` astraea ? '' \\n i said making away over to her . \\n i grabbed her arm , but she continued to look straight ahead , her mouth ajar . \\n `` is anybody going to answer me ? '' \\n dyos complained . \\n `` where are we ? \\n this place is giving me bad vibes . '' \\n the sound of running boots brought all of us to attention . \\n groups of creatures approached us , dressed in battle gear . \\n as they surrounded us , i took in the symbol on their armor . \\n now i know why astraea did n't reply . \\n we were no longer in pearu . \\n we were in her world . \\n we were in the world of the gods .\",\n          \"greenegauge a ya novel by jago piran smashwords edition , 2015 this is a work of fiction in which names , characters , places and incidents are products of the author 's imagination or are used fictitiously . \\n any resemblance to real persons , places , or events is completely coincidental . \\n chapter one there was no way they could ignore the noises of the row which rose and fell through the solid wooden door of their father 's office . \\n though they could not hear distinctly all the words , will and harry greene could tell that alan greene was attempting to be placatory . \\n it was his business partner , jonas stone , whose temper was flaring . \\n some of the adjectives he was using were clear enough : they were not the sort of words will or harry would use in front of their grandparents . \\n the brothers had just arrived home from castlemead college , the small but prestigious school in dorset where they boarded . \\n they had been picked up from the station by bruce mcintyre , their father 's fixer -- part butler , part steward , all friend -- who had rapidly become invaluable to alan greene after the death of greene 's wife , the boys ' mother , a few years previously . \\n he had helped them with their luggage , joking about the smell that leaked out of harry 's sports bag -- `` och , how i 've missed the sweet scent o ' your trainers . \\n get that window down , will ! '' \\n -- and , as the car pulled out into the busy traffic on the ring road , he demanded their news , glancing sideways at will and observing harry in the rear-view mirror , and stroking his luxuriant red moustaches all the time . \\n harry was characteristically enthusiastic about his cricketing exploits and refrained from exaggerating too much . \\n will was modest about his examination prospects , though he knew he 'd done enough work for them and secretly expected to do well . \\n they chatted animatedly during the ten minute drive from the city centre up the hill and into clifton village . \\n the car purred across the downs and slipped on to the ramp that carried it into the underground garage beneath the greene family home , prospect house . \\n there were several vehicles parked in the cavernous space . \\n one , however , caught will 's eye . \\n it was a dark blue bentley continental gt -lrb- the 4.2 v8 -rrb- . \\n `` uncle jonas here ? '' \\n he asked casually . \\n `` aye , he is . '' \\n the reply from mac was guarded . \\n `` how are things between them ? '' \\n `` och , the man 's becoming a menace . \\n the sooner your father 's shot o ' him the better . '' \\n the relationship between stone and greene had become strained over the last few months . \\n there was no hiding the fact from the boys . \\n the two men had been in partnership for years . \\n they had headed an extremely successful business , investing vast sums for mainly corporate clients . \\n now , alan greene wanted to dissolve the partnership in order to pursue other interests . \\n evidently , jonas was not impressed with the plan . \\n the door of the office opened suddenly . \\n stone strode out shouting over his shoulder , `` it 's madness , alan . \\n no matter how you dress it up . \\n you will regret it ; that i promise you . '' \\n `` hello , uncle jonas , '' will said . \\n he was not really the boys ' uncle ; but he had known them all their lives . \\n `` yeah , whatever ! '' \\n he snarled as he passed , flicking his blond fringe away from his eyes with a hand . \\n both boys were taken aback . \\n never before had stone spoken to them like that . \\n will was about to object , when mac warned him with a look . \\n mac accompanied stone down the broad flight of stairs to the landing below where he stepped into the lift which would take him to the basement garage . \\n a slightly weary alan greene appeared in the doorway , a sad look on his face . \\n he caught sight of his sons who were regarding him awkwardly . \\n a smile transformed his face . \\n he had not seen the boys for a fortnight . \\n now , he welcomed them , spreading his arms wide to embrace each in turn . \\n `` come in , come in , '' he said warmly . \\n `` sorry about that . \\n jonas and i are having a bit of a disagreement . \\n business , you know ? '' \\n he ushered them into the bright office which took up much of the top floor of the impressive georgian block which was prospect house . \\n the house stood on several floors , most of it given over to large high living space , which had been tastefully furnished by corinne greene , greene 's late wife . \\n the lower floors housed four apartments , two ostensibly for guests -lrb- though greene had done little entertaining recently -rrb- ; and one each for mac and the housekeeper , mrs emery . \\n will and harry took in the familiar view of brunel 's suspension bridge through the floor-to-ceiling windows along one wall . \\n the rest of the office was sparsely furnished -- a large desk surrounded by a clutch of chairs at one end , and a conference table , strewn with papers , at the other . \\n greene liked to have room to pace . \\n there was an air of expectation in the room . \\n at their last meeting , two weeks ago , when their father had driven to castlemead to take his sons to lunch , alan greene had told them that he had decided on a new business venture , one that he felt was of great importance . \\n he told them that his offer to jonas stone to join him had been rejected and he was looking for new partners . \\n while they waited for mrs emery to bring in tea , harry recounted details of the final match of the term , trying not to sound too boastful , though he had taken four wickets and hit the winning runs . \\n `` a cover drive , right out of the meat , '' he said . \\n `` four runs . \\n thank you very much . '' \\n he mimed the shot for his father 's benefit , smashing the imaginary ball through the window . \\n alan greene smiled again . \\n mrs emery left the room . \\n will , at sixteen , two years older than harry , had been curious about their father 's intimation that the future of greenestone , the company he and jonas had run so successfully , was in doubt . \\n in truth , will was worried . \\n the death of his mother had had a profound effect on him . \\n unsurprisingly . \\n all the certainties of his life had been suddenly shattered and , while he was not averse to change , he viewed the prospect with some caution . \\n alan greene was well aware of this . \\n he was pleased to have provided so well for his family , but had always been alive to the fact that the children of very wealthy individuals can occasionally go off the rails -- sometimes spectacularly . \\n as he regarded his sons -- will as tall as he was ; harry an inch shorter -- he felt proud that they had -lrb- so far -rrb- turned out to be so level-headed . \\n he knew from their housemaster that they were applying themselves to their schoolwork , that they threw themselves into the activities and sports available at castlemead and that they appeared to have adjusted to the tragedy that had befallen the family six years earlier . \\n after the loss of his wife he had flung himself into his work , taking millions of pounds for clients and turning them into billions . \\n it was only recently that he had realised that the manner of corinne greene 's death had lodged the kernel of the idea in his mind which had led him to the final angry meeting with jonas stone . \\n in the last month , he and stone had signed the papers that signalled the financial divorce between them . \\n the idea that had been half formed in his mind had crystallised and now he could not understand why it had not occurred to him sooner . \\n an unaccustomed nervousness threatened to overwhelm him as the time approached for him to share his proposal with harry and will . \\n *** he had planned to give the boys time to settle in , perhaps leave it until the next day to discuss matters with them . \\n however , the altercation with jonas stone seemed as good a starting point as any . \\n inviting his sons to sit at the desk , he perched on the edge of a chair next to them and began . \\n `` as you know , things have changed . \\n you will not have failed to realise that greenestone management has been in a period of flux . \\n this was due to a reassessment of my strategic aims and my rationalisation of core objectives . \\n i have repositioned my line of approach and ... '' greene broke off as he perceived the looks on his sons ' faces . \\n `` yeah , dad . \\n like we know what all that means , '' said harry , with a gallic shrug he had inherited from his mother . \\n `` sixteen . '' \\n will pointed to his own chest , paused , and went on : `` fourteen , '' pointing at harry . \\n he pointed at his father and said , cheekily , `` knocking fifty . \\n no more boardroom-speak . '' \\n `` bored-room , more like , '' harry chipped in with a smirk . \\n greene smiled , realising this pitch was not to faceless suits in the city of london . \\n `` sorry , guys , '' he said . \\n `` just tell us , simply , what you want to do . '' \\n alan greene took a deep breath . \\n `` i want to save the world ; and i want your help . '' \\n silence . \\n greene realised that he should really have eased them into this , rather than drop such an outlandish remark into the conversation . \\n hastily he said , `` it 's okay , boys . \\n i 've not gone mad . \\n i have n't taken leave of my senses and i have n't joined a cult . \\n `` answer me a question . '' \\n he looked levelly at his sons . \\n `` what 's the biggest threat to humanity and planet earth ? '' \\n `` terrorism ? '' \\n ventured harry . \\n `` no , '' will intervened . \\n `` it 's the climate . \\n global warming . '' \\n `` bingo ! '' \\n said greene . \\n `` so you want to stop global warming ? '' \\n asked will , cautiously . \\n `` no can do , '' said greene with a resigned shrug . \\n `` i 've had access to all the current data ; i 've spoken to scientists across the world . \\n i 've even had access to classified data that 's being suppressed for fear of causing panic . \\n there 's not a lot we can do to prevent a significant rise in the temperature of the planet ; it 's going to happen regardless of anything we do now . '' \\n he looked down briefly . \\n `` it killed your mother . \\n `` the earth 's climate is changing ; but it wo n't be like that film -- day after tomorrow ? \\n -- where everything happens hollywood-style : high-octane , fast-paced glamour . \\n it 'll be slow and painful ; there 'll be greed and hoarding . \\n nations will rush for resources that suddenly become economically viable . \\n the russians are , as we speak , staking their claim for the floor of the arctic ocean . \\n they 've sent a submarine to plant a flag ! \\n i kid you not . \\n `` but , '' he continued , swiftly , `` there are certain measures we can take to reduce the overall impact of the disaster . \\n by ` we ' , i mean the nations of the world . '' \\n will interrupted : `` you 've said before that no one is doing a thing worth doing . '' \\n `` and i 'm right , '' his father continued . \\n `` but i am also to blame . \\n and you 're to blame and you 're to blame . '' \\n he pointed at his sons . \\n `` oh , i just mean people , generally . \\n look : why should we , in the developed world -- europe , north america and so on -- make any concessions ? \\n we do the things that are easy enough : we recycle '' -- he placed air-speech marks around the word `` recycle '' , using the first two fingers of each hand -- `` we recycle our waste . \\n the council tells us to put our food in one bin , our cardboard in another , out glass in yet another . \\n if they are seen to be doing this , they get their funding from central government . \\n then they put it all in one hole in the ground . \\n `` and this is happening all over the world . \\n all the major nations of the earth are pretending to do something . \\n you 're too young to remember the kyoto treaty , but some years ago nearly the whole planet signed an agreement about greenhouse gases . \\n all but the usa . \\n that sort of undermined the whole point . \\n it 's like the chinese , now . \\n they want an industrial boom ; it 's difficult to argue when one sixth of the planet decide it 's their turn to do what the rest of us have been doing for a hundred years -- buying cars , and things for our homes ; flying abroad for a holiday ; eating whenever , out of season -- it does n't matter , as long as it 's convenient . '' \\n `` so if you ca n't stop it , what are you going to do ? '' \\n harry needed a straightforward answer . \\n `` i 'm going to do business in a completely different way . \\n i 've got the financial clout of a small country and , with my backers , i reckon i can make a real difference in the world of business . \\n from now on , all the investments i make will be ethically sound . \\n nothing i do will adversely affect the planet . \\n `` that 's where you two come in . \\n i 've been in the wrong business mind-set for too long to change quickly . \\n however , speed of change is essential if my little plan is to work . \\n i need your input . \\n you two are of the generation which will make the most important decisions regarding global warming and our response to it . '' \\n `` what do you mean ? '' \\n asked harry . \\n `` well , how much do you know of global warming ? '' \\n `` it 's a serious threat to the planet , to all our lives and , if we do n't do something about it , it 'll be disastrous . '' \\n he trotted out the doom-mongers ' mantra in a woe-is-me voice . \\n `` what do we need to do about it ? '' \\n `` be greener ? '' \\n harry replied , vaguely . \\n `` yes . \\n how , for instance ? '' \\n `` i do n't know ... '' he cast around for an answer . \\n `` use less power ; not so much petrol . '' \\n `` that would work , '' said his father encouragingly . \\n `` but give me a real example of how you would use less petrol . '' \\n harry looked blank . \\n `` how else could you have got home from the station this afternoon ? '' \\n prompted greene . \\n `` bus , '' said harry , as the penny dropped . \\n his elder brother entered the discussion . \\n `` you , on a bus ? \\n that , i 'd like to see . \\n you need all your comforts and someone to help lug your bags about . '' \\n `` i 'm perfectly prepared to get on a bus , '' harry maintained , somewhat haughtily . \\n `` when was the last time ? '' \\n `` what about you ? '' \\n `` the question was for you . '' \\n alan green raised his open hands in a appeasing gesture . \\n there was a wry smile on his face . \\n `` boys ! \\n calm . \\n look at what just happened . \\n it 's just like the international discussions . \\n nation blames nation and it degenerates into a slanging match . \\n `` now , if you are quite finished squabbling over the way in which the world should be saved , i 'd like us to set about actually doing something . \\n `` come and sit over here , '' he said , indicating the massive conference table which stood at the other end of the room . \\n the irony crossed his mind that his campaign for greener business was to start at a $ 30,000 mahogany table which had required the logging of three majestic trees , each over 200 years old , simply for the three broad planks which made up its polished surface . \\n he flipped up the lid of his laptop , pressing a button on a small remote-control device , as he did so . \\n the computer hummed to life ; the panoramic windows , which overlooked brunel 's masterpiece of engineering , became opaque , then dark , then light . \\n a message appeared on what had now become a large screen -- suriname : a greenegauge . \\n chapter two `` sorry about the pun , '' alan green said , slightly sheepishly , as he adjusted the laptop on his desk . \\n `` i had one of my researchers run this up ; he was obviously trying to impress the big boss . '' \\n will and harry slid into upright chairs and watched the presentation unfold . \\n as the title dissolved , a shot from a helicopter faded in . \\n thousands of acres of virgin rainforest rolled beneath the camera . \\n frankly , it could have been any of the millions of acres of verdant jungle across the equatorial belt which surrounded the globe but , knowing their father 's fondness for accuracy , the boys assumed they were looking at footage of suriname -- wherever that may be ; neither had heard of such a place . \\n green and blue filled the screen as trance music emanated from the speakers which the interior designers had hidden in the walls . \\n the narration began : south-west of the caribbean , a gem of a land , an unknown nugget of biodiversity , lies peacefully , waiting to be recognised for the jewel it is . \\n suriname . \\n both boys recognised the narrator 's familiar voice -- gravel soused in treacle -- from the harry potter talking books he had read to them so many times . \\n the `` r '' at the end of the first syllable of `` suriname '' left his mouth from the back , french style -- a soft roll ; the third syllable stretched the `` a '' out so that it rhymed with `` palm '' ; each of the three syllables was given equal weighting , again , as a french speaker would pronounce them : sur-i-narm . \\n the narration continued over a montage showing images of the country and its people : everyone 's heard of the south american giants : brazil , argentina , bolivia , peru . \\n but , tucked away in the north , between guyana and french guiana , lies the republic of suriname , perched just above the equator . \\n fewer than half a million people live in suriname ; about seven for every square mile . \\n compare that with the uk 's sixty million inhabitants . \\n that 's 640 per square mile . \\n at sixty-three thousand square miles , it is only two thirds the size of the united kingdom . \\n the vast majority of the population lives in a thin coastal strip in the north which is washed by the warm waters that drift east from the caribbean . \\n the presentation showed images of the capital , paramaribo , from the slightly shabby , faded glory of dutch colonisation , to the vibrant dockland area with beautiful fishing boats shimmering across a travel-brochure estuary . \\n just imagine england populated from the west as far as plymouth . \\n the only inhabited area is cornwall . \\n the rest ... virgin rainforest , for the most part , unexplored . \\n that 's a lot of jungle . \\n most of suriname is unknown -- genuine terra incognito . \\n at the start of the twenty-first century . \\n a fascinating prospect . \\n dreamy pan pipes with an echo enhancement emanated from the speakers now , as images of exotic flora and fauna , all as beautifully filmed as those in a bbc nature documentary , flitted across the screen . \\n there was no need for commentary : the boys and their father sat entranced by the shapes , colours and movements of nature . \\n amongst the lush foliage were flowers , huge and colourful , competing for attention ; botanical structures which defied the imagination : a lily pad across which a man might walk ; trees which towered hundreds of feet skywards ; grasses growing so densely and tall that they formed an impenetrable barrier . \\n cameras had sought out the reticent and the shy , jungle residents who , for one reason or another , would prefer not to be observed . \\n a flat brown shapeless leaf -- one amongst hundreds on the forest floor -- suddenly metamorphosed into a toad which loped away ; a streak of gold and black muscle rippled in a patch of sunlight as a jaguar sashayed through the undergrowth ; the sudden contrast , as an improbably constructed armadillo bumbled into shot . \\n it was a hypnotically assembled sequence which held the viewers ' attention entirely . \\n it ended with a close-up shot of what was clearly a frog , but of a type which neither of the boys had seen before . \\n in fact , it looked as though it had been painted . \\n across its shiny black skin where fluorescent purple markings which ringed its body . \\n the effect was that of some exotic dancer using reflective makeup to catch the strobes in a club . \\n alan greene pressed a button on his remote control and stilled the picture . \\n `` a year ago , '' he said , simply , `` that frog did n't exist , as far as the outside world was concerned . '' \\n he casually flipped a copy of the daily telegraph on to the table top where it slid to a halt . \\n it was already folded open at page five . \\n there , next to a colour photograph of the day-glow frog -lrb- or its cousin -rrb- , was the headline : ` extraordinary ' number of species discovered . \\n `` heard of suriname ? '' \\n the boys looked blank . \\n `` no reason for you to have heard of it . \\n it 's a small south american country with only a few notable resources . \\n as the video said , it 's mostly jungle . '' \\n greene senior paused . \\n `` and mostly unexplored . \\n `` a few weeks ago , i read the article in the paper , there . \\n i was shocked . \\n i thought it was a bit of green activist myth that there must be large numbers of species -- plant , as well as animal -- out there to be discovered in the great rainforests of the amazon . \\n you 've heard how the story goes : do n't cut down the rainforests , the lungs of the earth ; they may contain a cure for cancer ; blah , blah , blah . '' \\n the looks from his sons confirmed they were familiar with the line taken out by those their father had always referred to as `` the muesli and sandal brigade '' . \\n greene flipped a small heap of papers on to the polished surface . \\n will and harry leafed through them . \\n the times , from just a few months previously , carried a story about ballistic-tongued salamanders and hugely intricate flowers new to science , discovered in costa rica . \\n there was an account in the independent of how researchers in borneo were almost tripping over new finds . \\n and the guardian reported the bizarre existence , in tanzania , of a shrew the size of cat , related to elephants and aardvarks . \\n `` that 's the shrew , not the cat , '' will pointed out helpfully to harry . \\n while the boys read the stories -- all from the last year -- their father clicked on a few bookmarked web pages on his laptop . \\n he drew their attention to a series of articles on respected scientific websites which reported diverse finds from around the world : a new squid in the indian ocean ; a mountain-dwelling monkey in central africa ; frogs , butterflies and plants in new guinea ; ten new species of venezuelan fish ; a jellyfish without tentacles that inhabits the dark depths of the ocean trenches . \\n greene paused . \\n `` this is only the beginning of the story . \\n the more you look , the more remarkable finds come to light . \\n these places are the last wildernesses on earth . \\n many of them happen to be home to the planet 's great rainforests . \\n they are remote and , often , unregulated . \\n unseen destruction goes on daily by people who should know better . \\n people like me . '' \\n `` bit harsh , '' will observed . \\n `` but ultimately , who 's responsible for the logging ? \\n who puts the strip-mining operation in and abandons the site when they 've got what they want ? \\n who takes advantage of the locals ? \\n it 's business . \\n pure and simple . '' \\n `` so what 's the next step ? \\n how far have you got with these plans ? '' \\n will was curious because he sensed that he and his brother were going to be used as more than just sounding boards by their father . \\n `` my very next business proposition just happens to be right in the heart of suriname . \\n so , instead of relying on reports which take no account of the life -- human , animal and plant -- that thrives in the area , i 'm going there to see for myself . \\n fancy tagging along ? \\n it might be interesting . \\n and a fresh pair of eyes or two might make all the difference . '' \\n *** the prospect of the trip affected the brothers in different ways . \\n will , who had always been open to new ideas and was naturally curious about the world around him , spent hours researching suriname . \\n if there were sights to be seen , he did n't want to miss out over a lack of planning . \\n harry , on the other hand , might have been perceived as lacking enthusiasm for what appeared to be a dream holiday . \\n the prospect of warm blue seas to surf and jet ski and the adventure of exploring the rainforest should have appealed to any young man . \\n and , in fact , harry was quite enthused by the idea . \\n it was just that going to south america and not seeing the giants of world football -- brazil and argentina , even colombia and uruguay -- seemed to harry to be perverse . \\n it was like visiting merseyside and going to see tranmere rovers when the liverpool v. everton derby was on . \\n not that merseyside was where he got his football fix from : he had been a true blue chelsea fan since before greene had moved his family from london the bristol . \\n they settled in with the thoughts of suriname and their father 's unusual offer occupying their minds both will and harry possessed state-of-the-art computers . \\n one of the major advantages of having alan greene as a father was that whenever he showed an interest in a company , the company happily sent him their latest products for appraisal . \\n the brothers were the envy of their friends who , although equipped with the best machines money could buy , could not match their versions which money could not yet buy . \\n both used the technology like professionals . \\n in doing so , of course , they were testing the latest advances and usually confirming their father 's instinct for progress : they , after all , were highly representative of the consumers of tomorrow . \\n harry spent a lot of time gaming -- online against remote opponents was his preferred option . \\n will enjoyed that , too , but was beginning to find it more and more satisfying to understand how the programming worked . \\n he was rapidly becoming intuitively aware of how software might be written to perform whatever task may be asked of it . \\n and , of course , like any teenagers , they used the myriad of functions and apps which were available and which they found made their lives richer and easier to organise . \\n while will was updating his entry on facebook , to include details of the proposed trip to suriname , harry was putting the final touches to the hi-top basketball boots he fancied . \\n he 'd seen his favourite movie star , will smith , wearing a pair in one of his films and been delighted when he checked the converse web site . \\n not only were the boots available , but he was invited to put together his own design and personalise them . \\n a few clicks and he had them just how he wanted them : lime green outside body colour ; pink , for the inside ; a yellow and black stripe for the tongue ; blood-red laces ; sidewall in white -- naturally ; a scarlet racing stripe ; and the legend , greeneboy -lrb- his nickname at school -rrb- , down the blue heel stripe . \\n he hit the return key with a flourish . \\n sixty bucks : bargain . \\n harry greene : taste bypass . \\n he was fourteen ; he was happy . \\n `` hey ! '' \\n will called over his shoulder from his computer screen . \\n `` you do n't need to go to brazil ; forget pele ; forget fabiano . \\n check out the surinamese footy guys . '' \\n harry ambled over as will flicked between web pages . \\n there was a very healthy smattering of world-class talent emanating from the south american country that neither boy had heard of two or three hours previously . \\n it seemed that suriname had been a dutch colony for much of the last 300 years and , as a result of the close ties between suriname and the netherlands since independence in 1975 , the dutch had welcomed such great players as frank rijkaard , ruud gulit and patrick kluivert into their clubs and national side . \\n harry found it difficult to believe that jimmy floyd hasselbaink and edgar davids , both ex-stalwarts of the english premiership , were from paramaribo , suriname 's capital . \\n ever heard of anyone from suriname ? \\n ever heard of suriname ? \\n now he was keen on the place . \\n `` and malouda , '' will pointed out , `` comes from french guyana , bang next door to suriname . '' \\n harry had pictures of the former chelsea winger on his bedroom wall and footage of his winner against liverpool in the fa cup final on his phone . \\n will shut down the pages that had got harry excited , as his younger brother wandered off to phone a friend about the greats that suriname had produced . \\n will still had things to do . \\n earlier in the evening , when he 'd announced his plans for the boys to join him in his quest for greener business , their father had elaborated on his particular interest in suriname . \\n he wanted to mine something called bauxite . \\n suriname possessed some of the world 's greatest reserves of this ore . \\n harry had not been particularly interested in what his father had to say ; will , however , had nodded sagely when the conversation had taken place . \\n it was entirely possible that his father would expect him to know what bauxite was . \\n some time invested on the internet would , therefore , be well spent . \\n will had a natural thirst for knowledge and www.whatever was a home from home for him . \\n the boys had been presented with a quite astonishing proposal by their father . \\n and the more they learned about the country neither had heard of before , the more intrigued they became . \\n they took themselves off to bed with spinning heads , little knowing what the next few weeks would hold for them . \\n chapter three the following morning , in a sliver of glass and steel 190 kilometres away and 120 metres off the ground , a soft beep announced the arrival of an email . \\n a notice slid discreetly up from the bottom of one of the huge computer monitors ranged around the desk to confirm this . \\n the man sitting in front of the screens moved his right hand within a crystal sphere the size of a small football which sat on the polished teak desktop . \\n it was an experimental device which replicated the precision of a computer mouse and added a tenfold field of options . \\n a skilled operator could carry out multiple operations within the light matrix generated by the sphere just by moving fingers . \\n the developer of the device -- code-named emanual -- even claimed that the qwerty keyboard 's days were numbered . \\n the man in the office at the top of the tallest building in britain revelled in new technology . \\n he flicked his wrist and the email opened on the screen before him . \\n the message read : flight plan for greene aircraft has been filed for tuesday evening , 21.30 , local time . \\n confirm destination : zanderij international airport , suriname , via jfk . \\n eta wednesday 10.15 , local . \\n there was no name at the bottom . \\n but the man recognised the email address -- one from a cloud-based server that would be impossible to trace . \\n it was from one of his secret assets . \\n his belief that information was power had rarely let him down during his stella business career ; and he had always been prepared to pay for it . \\n his `` assets '' , as he called them , were individuals in various locations throughout the world that -- for one reason or another -- he knew he could rely on to do his bidding and supply useful information . \\n some of them he paid . \\n and he paid well . \\n some of them owed him . \\n the sender of the e-mail was an administration officer at bristol international airport . \\n jonas stone was a man of middling height and of middling build . \\n he was pale of complexion and wore his blond hair swept back from his forehead . \\n his face , though a little gaunt , was saved from ordinariness by a pair of startlingly blue eyes . \\n they seemed to bore straight out of his skull , a pair sapphire lasers . \\n people meeting him for the first time often found themselves mesmerised . \\n stone had realised this at a very young age and had been utilising this genetic gift ever since . \\n it gave him an edge as a businessman . \\n stone 's mind turned to one of his other secret assets as his right hand flitted about inside the light matrix of the emanual pulling up files and web pages from a folder marked best-enjoyed-cold . \\n it was an extensive encrypted folder that could be accessed by nobody else in the world . \\n it contained stone 's plan to destroy alan greene . \\n it may seem irrational that a man who owed so much to alan greene could possibly contemplate hurting him . \\n and stone 's motives were , to the dispassionate observer , just that : irrational . \\n however , when a man 's net worth passes a certain figure , there is very little that may be done to dissuade him of what others might consider a foolish , an illogical -- even a self-destructive -- course of action . \\n jonas stone 's net worth had long ago exceeded the notional figure at which logic is sometimes replaced by arrogance . \\n that he owned extensive offices which sat just beneath the great pyramid roof of one of the world 's most distinctive business tower blocks at the centre of the city that dominated the world 's money markets , vouched for this . \\n stone had embraced the lifestyle greenestone had given him . \\n he simply loved it . \\n he had a collection of souvenirs from many of the company 's extravagant parties and social functions . \\n he loved to be centre of attention ; hated being ignored . \\n now , as he leafed through the files in b-e-c , he dwelled on an mpeg-4 which played back footage from a concert greenestone had staged for its once extensive staff . \\n sir mick jaggar pranced regally on stage in the background , while stone , himself , was pictured arm in arm with kylie minogue -lrb- he 'd even blagged a kiss ! -rrb- . \\n the point was , he was recognised , even by celeb royalty . \\n he was a recognised player : a success . \\n jonas stone was a name that the tabloid press enjoyed using -- he was a lad who 'd made good . \\n he was a bit of a bloke . \\n every area of life seemed to have its celebrities and he was a huge business celebrity . \\n bigger than the apprentice boss -- sugar , was it ? \\n way bigger than the dragons in the den . \\n in fact , stone often reflected , that beardy richard geezer with his balloons and space holidays ought to look out . \\n he spent his money in just the way anyone would if they had them -- cars , houses , parties , holidays , dangerous sports , exotic girlfriends . \\n he was universally admired . \\n his laddish antics were reported with fervour in the papers . \\n a scanned newspaper article caught his eye ; he opened it . \\n it was a report of one of his more extravagant antics . \\n one summer weekend he had hired brands hatch , the iconic racing circuit in kent , and invited a selection of clients to join him . \\n he had arranged for a number of the most desirable cars of the day to be available for the guests to play with . \\n there was a pair of aston martins , four of five porsches , a clutch of ferraris and several other examples of automotive exotica . \\n a younger stone stared from the picture on the screen , a smile on his face , a bottle of veuve clicquot in his hand , as he prepared to drive a scarlet lamborghini diablo , a 200 mph-plus wedge of supercar . \\n though the report attempted a tone of disapproval of the day 's sport , mingling as it did with drink , there was a noticeable hint of envy in the writing . \\n stone and his fellow racers were doing what every other young man in the country wanted to do . \\n by the end of the piece , the reporter seemed gleeful as he detailed the cost of the damage done to nearly two million pounds ' worth of cars . \\n stone smiled at the memory and at the report 's estimate of what it had cost greenestone : it had cost almost twice as much ; but had brought in close on half a billion in extra investment . \\n in one day . \\n that was the sort of legend stone was pleased to write for himself . \\n in a club as exclusive as the square mile , one had to be pretty special to create this kind of coverage . \\n that was what he lived for . \\n but , with the demise of greenestone , his name had , literally , been removed from the precincts of the city of london , the most powerful temple to mammon on the planet . \\n and it was a huge humiliation . \\n and he blamed alan greene . \\n stone gazed through the glass walls of his office across london . \\n he had risen above the common herd . \\n his success -- and he was successful in his own right -- was , nevertheless , coupled with that of greene . \\n and vice versa . \\n only now , it seemed , greene had no need for stone . \\n and that hurt . \\n on a business level , of course , jonas stone understood that greene had no real need any more for someone to bring in new investment . \\n greene 's share of greenestone was massive enough to have its own financial gravitational field : money attracts money . \\n stone understood greene could now fund any bizarre scheme he chose without having to raise capital from investors . \\n that had been stone 's forte . \\n and now he felt discarded . \\n it was really quite important to him that alan greene 's new venture fail . \\n stone knew all about the bauxite mining concern in suriname ; greene had laid it out before him : all the details , estimates of top lines , bottom lines , prospects for the future . \\n it had looked pretty good to stone , on paper . \\n however , he equally saw that in the deep interior of a country with relatively few regulations and even fewer officers to enforce those few regulations , it was a licence to flout all the rules in the pursuit of the greatest profit . \\n greene had costly ideas about restoring the rainforest to its original state . \\n a waste of good money , stone had thought ; there are millions of hectares of rainforest . \\n would the world really miss the odd couple of hundred ? \\n there were gaps in stone 's knowledge of the surinamese venture . \\n but , he felt , none large enough to prevent his ruining it . \\n of course , he was not going to dirty his own hands . \\n oh , no ! \\n he still had too much to lose . \\n he touched the tip of his forefinger to the tip of his thumb in the emanual and a file in b-e-c appeared on the electronic desk top . \\n a photograph marked the beginning of the file . \\n it showed the face and upper body of a man staring blankly into the lens . \\n he wore an orange jumpsuit . \\n behind him , the wall had been painted with a series of equally spaced horizontal lines -- 1.60 m , 1.70 m , 1.80 m , and so on . \\n the man in the picture stood a shade under two metres . \\n across the bottom of the image were the words , texas state penitentiary . \\n stone smiled coldly at the image and nodded to himself . \\n this was one of his most secret assets . \\n he was known to jonas stone as mw . \\n stone had gone to a lot of trouble to ensure that mw was no longer in residence at one of america 's infamous penal establishments . \\n he began to compose an email . \\n chapter four jonas stone was far from the minds of the greenes a couple of days later as they set off for suriname . \\n it was evening when they , together with mac , found themselves heading out across the severn estuary , the tinge of excitement that goes with air travel upon each of them . \\n gazing out of the starboard windows , they spotted the two severn crossings . \\n the slowly setting sun glinted off the superstructure of the nearer bridge , six kilometres to the north . \\n their passage through the airport had been straightforward ; a cursory nod from the security guard as he raised the red and white striped barrier and they swept across the tarmac to park at the foot of the steps which led up to the plane . \\n an official glanced at their passports , wished them well , and departed , as the steps were driven away and the pilot warmed up the engines and asked the tower 's permission to taxi to the main runway . \\n air travel was so much more pleasurable when one had one 's own aircraft . \\n this was the first real trip since alan greene 's new plane had been delivered . \\n he 'd made do , until recently , with a bombardier-learjet , but realised his plans would require a more substantial mobile base in the future . \\n buying a plane is just like buying anything else . \\n those with sense shop around and greene had done exactly that before deciding that boeing offered the right package . \\n the boeing business jet -- or bbj -- was based on the company 's successful 737 model and was available in various configurations . \\n all of which greene had thrown out . \\n the customer base for mid-sized private jets is , not surprisingly , quite small . \\n not only does it take north of $ 40,000,000 to buy an entry-level model , but it costs about $ 750,000 a year to run it . \\n all the companies that produce such executive transport research their target market -- oil-sheiks , billionaire ceos from around the world , stars of music , film and sport , all trying to show they are richer and classier than the others -- and tailor their interiors to suit . \\n there is a lot of marble , polished granite ; herds of leather , soft and dyed pastel shades ; deep , rich carpets ; lighting that complements the d\\u00e9cor ; and , of course , state-of-the-art toys -- sound systems , computers , games consoles . \\n greene had particularly shunned the shiny , gold-tapped bathrooms in the models he 'd been shown . \\n some of the salespeople , unused to a lack of ostentation , were astonished when he instructed them to fit out the plane simply and functionally . \\n that was not to say it lacked comfort ; greene 's tastes ran to leather on his chairs and fine quality finishes . \\n there was a need for gadgets and gizmos ; but he saw no need to show off . \\n as he had put it , he was `` a businessman , not a bling-merchant '' . \\n his simply stated requirements were met perfectly by boeing -lrb- they would designate the resultant configuration the restraint -rrb- . \\n the sleek tube of the airframe had been divided into four main sections . \\n immediately to the rear of the flight-deck -lrb- the only non-negotiable section of the aircraft -rrb- was a compact galley where food could be prepared for delivery to passengers in the main cabin . \\n the cabin -- over 13 metres long and three and a half metres wide -- was intended as a multi-purpose living and working space . \\n one end contained an office with conference table and chairs , computers and communications facilities ; at the other end , were comfortable couches which converted to beds , and an entertainment centre . \\n beyond the cabin , a master bedroom provided the ultimate comfort for long-haul travel -- a full-sized double bed . \\n there was an adjacent shower room and lavatory . \\n plenty of room remained within the aircraft for storage . \\n it was difficult to believe that the great silver tube might accommodate 220 holiday-makers under different circumstances . \\n of course , with such a cargo , the aeroplane 's performance was restricted . \\n on this evening , it would be cruising at just over 1,000 kilometres per hour , at over 40,000 feet -- twelve and a half kilometres up . \\n despite the extended range of the boeing , it still had to fly via new york 's jfk for refuelling during the night . \\n after a light supper , brought to them by a flight attendant provided by the company that managed the aircraft , all four got their heads down for the night . \\n the boys awoke as the sun came up , streaming into the cabin , and illuminating the string of caribbean islands to the west -- guadeloupe , dominica , martinique . \\n a long way further south , were grenada and barbados -lrb- where the greenes had holidayed on more than one occasion -rrb- . \\n they were up and peering through the windows when their father entered the main cabin . \\n evidently , greene had left instructions , as the conference area had been laid for breakfast . \\n the flight attendant , smartly but simply dressed , emerged from the compact staff rest area below the galley , relayed the information from the pilot that they had just turned on to the south-easterly heading that would bring them on to their final approach to suriname ; their anticipated time of arrival was 10am , local time , three hours from now . \\n mac joined them as they sat down to eat . \\n there was a little good-hearted ribbing about being in a confined space with harry 's feet though , in truth , his new hi tops -- delivered by speed courier the previous morning -- were too new to harbour his own personal `` perfume '' , as he 'd put it . \\n and , in any case , he had left them at the far end of the cabin , just in case . \\n as they finished off scrambled eggs and toast , washing it down with coffee , their thoughts turned to the task ahead . \\n greene did n't wait for the breakfast things to be cleared away , merely pushing them aside as he opened his laptop . \\n `` you know what bauxite is ? '' \\n he asked , without preamble . \\n harry did n't ; will recalled it from his geography gcse course and his trawl on the internet . \\n `` it 's aluminium , is n't it ? '' \\n he said , casually . \\n `` it 's the ore that we extract aluminium from . \\n and aluminium is vital to modern life . \\n it 's all around us . '' \\n greene tapped the plastic moulding of the cabin wall with a finger . \\n `` behind this , the airframe is aluminium . \\n it 's light and strong . \\n motor cars are increasingly being built of aluminium : less weight , less fuel . \\n you two are n't paying for petrol yet . \\n just you wait ... '' he chuckled . \\n `` tin cans : '' he tossed a coke to each of his sons , `` aluminium ; tin foil : aluminium . \\n it 's used in the building industry ; pots and pans for cooking ; paint ; and in dozens of chemical processes . \\n there are millions of miles of power lines across the country , '' he nodded . \\n `` aluminium . \\n i 've researched this stuff and i do n't know how many more uses are still to be discovered . \\n but it 's pretty versatile . \\n we need aluminium . \\n we 're not going to stop using it just because of global warming . \\n and there 's plenty of it . \\n the most abundant metal on earth : we 're not going to run out of it . \\n `` and if i can get it out of the ground -- especially ecologically sensitive ground -- cheaper and more responsibly than others , i 'm doing my bit for the planet . '' \\n greene clicked on an icon on the desktop of his computer and , while the application loaded , he explained to his sons that mining bauxite was one of suriname 's leading industries and it was estimated that it would grow dramatically over the next decade ; huge reserves had been identified . \\n frustratingly , he told them , the deposits were located deep within the densely forested sipaliwini district of suriname . \\n the district is by far the largest part of the country , considerably larger than the remaining nine districts put together , but almost unpopulated . \\n villages are few and far between and support an ancient traditional lifestyle . \\n most communication is via the river system . \\n `` there are still tribes there that use the forest as their supermarket , hardware store and pharmacy . \\n they get everything they need from the land and the river . '' \\n mac , an ex-pipe major of the royal scots dragoon guards , agreed . \\n `` the british army learned a lo ' from tribes in the amazon basin . \\n these guys in suriname are the same : they know the jungle ; they know what 's good tae eat , what 's gon na give ye a wee tummy upset . \\n ye need a shelter ? \\n these guys are y ' best friends . \\n `` it 's a beautiful place , the rainforest ; beautiful and fascinatin ' . \\n but it 's also one of the most dangerous and impenetrable places o ' the planet for those that dinnae know it . '' \\n as if on cue , a large slim television screen rose smoothly from a bulkhead and flickered to life , replicating the picture on alan greene 's laptop . \\n google earth . \\n planet earth , the uk in the middle , sat serenely in the black velvet of space . \\n greene clicked on a bookmark . \\n the earth moved for him , spinning slowly in an easterly direction and advancing at the same time to fill the screen . \\n both the americas -- north and south -- swung smoothly into view . \\n then the perspective changed as the panorama focused more tightly on the north coast of the southern american continent . \\n suddenly , as the view descended , the names and boundaries of the countries were superimposed on the image . \\n yellow lines delineated the vastness of brazil ; to the west were peru , ecuador , columbia and venezuela . \\n as the perspective continued to change , guyana and french guinea came into sharper focus . \\n and there , nestled between them , was suriname . \\n from this altitude , the three countries looked like pieces from a colossal jigsaw puzzle . \\n the satellite imagery paused at 600 kilometres and there on the screen was their destination . \\n the country was entirely green . \\n will spotted paramaribo in the north -lrb- or rather the red star used to denote a country 's capital -rrb- and harry pointed at the screen and mispronounced sipaliwini . \\n the name of the province came out of his mouth more like `` sapal-winey '' . \\n the others laughed . \\n at this altitude , few features were clear . \\n the dappling of white across swathes of the country were clouds ; however , the viewpoint offered on the screen was still hundreds of kilometres above even the highest of them . \\n the boys ' father pointed out the separate districts of the country -- grey lines , this time -- crowded into the north and east of the land as though overawed by their huge big brother , sipaliwini . \\n only one dared to trespass south of the coastal strip into the forbidding interior . \\n it looked out of place , like an interloper . \\n greene rolled his cursor over a blue blur and double clicked . \\n the satellite picture adjusted its position and zoomed in on the target , stopping this time at 150 kilometres . \\n will kept an eye on the altitude counter at the bottom right of the screen . \\n now clouds , even though still way below the vantage point , became individually discernible . \\n the blue blur revealed itself to be a huge lake , a myriad of rivers and tributaries feeding it . \\n its name was superimposed on its surface : brokopondo . \\n `` now , this place we 're interested in , '' said greene . \\n `` a lake , '' said harry flatly . \\n `` in the middle of the jungle . '' \\n `` oh , yes , '' greene responded . \\n `` take a look at this . '' \\n he placed the cursor over the image at the northern edge of the lake and scrolled in , stopping just 2,000 metres above the ground . \\n through gossamer cloud they could now see a long narrow manmade structure stretching east to west . \\n to the south of it was the lake ; to its north , a network of roads and a watercourse . \\n will recognised it first . \\n `` is it a dam ? '' \\n he peered at the image and saw the tell-tale white water where sluices had stood open when the satellite image had been created . \\n `` just so , '' greene confirmed . \\n `` and the lake is manmade ... '' `` cool , '' was harry 's judgement . \\n `` ... but we 'll see it for real in a day or two . \\n i want to look at the main reason for our trip . '' \\n deftly , he scrolled up to 400 kilometres , located a spot on the image and clicked on it . \\n it was clearly in the middle of the jungle and deep within sipaliwini yet , as they zoomed in to 100 kilometres , everyone noticed the area was one of highest resolution . \\n when the project to place images of the earth 's surface online was first undertaken , judgements were made about which areas would be most interesting to people and , therefore , which should be prioritised and photographed in the highest definition . \\n the middle of the sahara desert , for instance , while of passing interest to nomadic tuaregs , did not warrant the same expensive satellite photography as did notting hill in london , or manhattan in new york , where simply everyone has access to the internet and has , at least once , zoomed in on their own roof . \\n it was a surprise , therefore , to see a strip of land rendered in the highest detail available -lrb- outside the military -rrb- in the middle of remote sipaliwini . \\n will and harry , both of whom had played with google earth in the past , queried this . \\n greene senior smiled and said : `` it helps if you happen to know someone in the company . \\n i 've got a pal called larry and i rang him a while ago and asked him to see whether he could arrange for the next satellite pass to do a little detailed work at this position . '' \\n so saying , greene tapped in a set of coordinates and the viewpoint swung down towards the jungle , once more . \\n at 10,000 metres , the tableau resembled a highly detailed map . \\n by the time the camera had eased down to 3,500 metres , it was easy to make out the tops of individual trees within the thick canopy ; dun clearings stood baldly out from the green ; and the river , untroubled by a network of silt islands , meandered serenely north . \\n on the east bank , a great scar cut deeply into the jungle -- an almost perfect half-circle of brown . \\n that was the only way the boys could describe it : from that height , that 's what they saw . \\n `` the apetina mine , '' announced alan greene . \\n when he zoomed in , they were impressed . \\n the sharpness of the picture picked out what was plainly an open-cast mine . \\n there were great machines -- diggers , earth-movers , cranes -- at work over the great area which was being worked . \\n some of them the boys recognised ; some were larger than anything they had ever seen or imagined , with gantries and conveyor-belts stretching for hundreds of metres . \\n even the smaller details of the site were apparent : a jeep with four occupants ; the rectangular forms of billets ; more buildings -- presumably , administrative or storage ; the h of a helicopter landing pad . \\n sticking out into the river were two jetties , one much larger than the other . \\n the image of a great barge had been captured by the distant satellite , either about to dock at the more southern of the two , or in the process of departing . \\n greene zoomed in . \\n the barge was fully laden : clearly on its way downstream to paramaribo . \\n for hundreds of kilometres all around -lrb- thousands , to the south -rrb- , there was nothing other than rainforest , dense , dark and , for the first time to will , foreboding . \\n there were no roads , no other signs of humanity or of civilisation . \\n the only way in was by air or by river . \\n it might as well have been on another planet . \\n greene thought it a good time to add some detail to the plans he 'd outlined to his sons . \\n he scrolled back up to paramaribo and began . \\n `` we 're here for two nights , just to get our bearings before we fly down to the mine . \\n we 'll spend the day inspecting the whole operation . \\n the financial side already stacks up ; it 's just the environmental implications which we need to ensure are acceptable . \\n we know there are ways of extracting the ore which have little impact on the forest ; if they are used , we should n't have a problem . '' \\n as he spoke he moved the cursor south from paramaribo until it hovered over the mine . \\n `` we 'll stay at the apetina mine for the night , tidy up any remaining business the following day and then it 's a slow , leisurely ride north along the ezel river back to lake brokopondo . \\n you 'll never get a better chance to see the planet at its best and most lush . '' \\n it all sounded very straightforward . \\n chapter five there was trouble brewing at discerning antiques , situated just off the main drag in the heart of downtown orlando , florida . \\n a small but insistent crowd had gathered on the sidewalk during lunchtime . \\n the glass door of the small business was shut and locked ; a closed sign , hanging inside , promised the afternoon 's trading would begin at two o\\u2019clock sharp . \\n it was already twenty past two and , apart from a glimpse of shadowy movement to the rear of the shop , there had been no sign of life . \\n the crowd grew increasingly impatient , and alarmed , as people realised they were all there for the same reason . \\n three months ago , the real estate agent had been delighted to close the deal with the tall , well-built , confident gentleman from texas . \\n he had taken the showroom , in an affluent part of town , saying he intended to expand his dealership across the southern states -- he had a large number of outlets already , and florida was his next objective . \\n he 'd quoted his business motto , which , incidentally , was picked out in gold letters in the shop window : we turn old to gold ; give it to us : consider it sold . \\n the agent had thought it inspiring , had wished him well , blushed and declined his charming offer of dinner that evening and left to spread the word among her well-off friends and business associates that discerning antiques might become the go-to place for tasteful home furnishings . \\n for a while , it had seemed she 'd been right . \\n only the best shop fitters were employed to create the right atmosphere for the business , where people of good taste might come to discuss the sale or acquisition of valuable items . \\n advertisements were placed in glossy magazines inviting those with items `` that may be of interest to our discerning international clientele '' to have them appraised . \\n and , for a fortnight , it seemed that every person of note in the orlando business community received a visit or a personal phone call from the proprietor . \\n the result was that when the business opened , there were almost too many people clamouring for attention . \\n mw had picked orlando as it was home to many older people ; people who might possess an antique or two ; people who might be sweet-talked into handing them over , with the promise of a good price being secured . \\n mw loved old people : so trusting of a prosperous and knowledgeable texan gentleman with a trimmed beard and a twinkle in his eye . \\n for eight glorious weeks , he took valuable items from those trusting souls and exchanged them for large amounts of cash -- `` i 'm obliged : we 're a cash business for reasons of charitable status , '' he 'd explain -- from the wealthy folk of the state . \\n whenever a seller -- usually an elderly lady on her own -- overcame the embarrassment of bringing up the subject of money , mw would use terms like `` cash throughput '' , `` liquidity considerations '' and `` investment parameters '' , insist that the money transfer was held up by the bank -lrb- `` ai n't it always the way ? '' \\n and he 'd roll his eyes -rrb- , and hand them back into their cars with murmurs of reassurance . \\n he had run the scam , using various false names , in many locations across the states . \\n the stetson , the ivory-tipped walking cane , the bootlace tie , all contributed to the image . \\n eight weeks , he thought , was middling , as he eyed the crowd outside . \\n the real estate agent was at the point of instructing lawyers to sue for three months ' rental -lrb- and demand an eviction -rrb- ; the tiresome shop fitters wanted an exorbitant amount for the teak and oak display cases they 'd constructed ; some interfering debt-collector was shoving a red invoice under the door ; even the sign writer was out there pointing at his work , complaining to whoever would listen . \\n eight weeks . \\n mw sighed and moved to the rear of the building . \\n `` i 'm just going to sort out the checks for these good and patient people , '' he told christina , the young lady he 'd employed to carry out the administrative duties of his business . \\n `` do n't let them damage the front of the shop . \\n let them in , in ten minutes . '' \\n christina , who had not yet been paid for two months ' work , herself , glanced at the disappearing back of her employer and then looked with some unease between the display shelves at the crowd . \\n a man with a walking stick had set himself up as a rabble-rouser and was waving his stick belligerently at the window , shouting something provocative . \\n it was a little like watching a riot in slow motion , given the advanced years of many of the participants . \\n in the relative safety of his office , mw clicked shut his laptop and stowed it in its carry case . \\n the email he 'd received an hour or so earlier confirmed his next course of action . \\n he took the computer and a medium-sized suitcase , stepped through the rear door of the antiques dealership and , without a backward glance , did what he had done so often before . \\n he always kept money in reserve , for those `` just-in-case '' moments , such as this . \\n he stepped into a cab , casually stated his destination and flipped up the lid of the laptop once more . \\n he had always believed that when a change is needed , something will turn up . \\n and turn up it just had . \\n he re-read the email : calling in a favour -lrb- or `` favor '' , if you prefer -rrb- . \\n how does s. america sound ? \\n expenses paid . \\n disruption work and interference -- just the job for you . \\n success = $ 5 very large . \\n a mobile telephone number finished off the message . \\n the email address from which the message had originated was not familiar to mw . \\n nevertheless , he knew who had sent it . \\n the cab poked its nose into the traffic and picked up speed as it passed the front of discerning antiques . \\n mw slipped the stetson from his head -- no need to draw unnecessary attention to himself . \\n he need n't have worried : all the crowd 's attention was focussed on the door which christina was in the process of opening . \\n he reached into the laptop carry case and selected one of three passports , each of them excellent forgeries , each of them made out in a different false name . \\n he flipped the lid of the suitcase and extracted one of a large number of bundles of bank notes , slipping it into the inside pocket of his jacket . \\n one of the other reasons he 'd chosen this part of town was that orlando executive airport was only a few blocks away . \\n he drew out his phone and called the mobile phone number detailed in the email to see where , precisely , he was headed . \\n chapter six there was a ten minute transfer from zanderij international airport aboard the airport 's own courtesy helicopter -- air taxi was stencilled on its side . \\n it was a small comfortable bell 407 with room for five passengers . \\n it easily took the greenes and mac and all their personal luggage the forty kilometres north to the surinamese capital . \\n the smiling pilot whisked them fast and low over the densely forested ground which surrounded the airport complex , as the early morning sun climbed into a blue sky which was tinged with some grey cloud . \\n as they approached the outskirts of the city , more roads cut through the green foliage ; some smart-looking suburbs , arranged geometrically , came into view . \\n and then , suddenly , they were over tightly packed housing , interspersed with what could have been warehouses or factories . \\n the great river suriname followed their progress , without interest , it seemed , over to the east and , to the north , the boys spied the atlantic ocean blue-grey and infinite . \\n the pitch of the turbo shaft engine shifted slightly as the pilot eased back to descend on to the field at one end of the runway at zorg en hoop airport . \\n from their elevated position , the passengers were able to take in the small , city airstrip . \\n it accommodated only light aircraft -- fixed wing propeller-driven planes and helicopters -- judging by its runway which could not have exceeded half a kilometre and had a well-used run-off strip at one end . \\n there was a healthy selection of planes and choppers and a range of low-slung hangars and office buildings . \\n as they hopped out , dragging bags with them , they were disappointed at the overcast conditions . \\n it was hot and humid , but the sun was struggling to make an impression on the low cloud cover . \\n for the tropics , it was a bit of a let-down . \\n their driver explained , as they covered the short journey to the petrus stuyvesant hotel right in the heart of the historic centre of the city that the rainy season was dripping to an end ; that the weather usually associated with palm trees , sandy beaches and glittering blue sea , would soon return to suriname . \\n the hotel was the newest in the city . \\n smart but discreet , it blended with its old colonial neighbours . \\n wooden reminders of the country 's past -- architectural influences from holland -- blended with more modern buildings . \\n the street , where they pulled up , was lined with trees and red-roofed shops . \\n a few cars passed as they stepped into the air conditioned atmosphere of the reception hall . \\n mac took his leave as soon as they 'd checked in : he had arrangements to make that `` willnae make themselves . '' \\n alan greene had business to catch up on and disappeared . \\n will and harry had the day to themselves and a new city to explore . \\n after ditching bags in their rooms , they left the cool confines of the lobby and strode into the oppressive midday heat . \\n across the street , leaning against the side of a small general store , in the shadow of a green awning , a figure glanced up from beneath the brim of a white stetson . \\n a pair of dark eyes flicked from the two boys to a photograph on his mobile phone . \\n the man smiled to himself and withdrew around a corner . \\n he turned and walked away . \\n mw had arrived in the surinamese capital the previous day , flying in from orlando , via port of spain , where he 'd had to change planes . \\n he had found himself a hotel which offered all the luxuries he was going to avoid paying for , if he possibly could . \\n and he 'd tracked down his targets . \\n he was ahead of schedule . \\n he began to give some thought to what his next course of action should be . \\n the offer from stone had arrived at just the right time . \\n the antiques business in orlando has run its course ; mw had earned -lrb- he hated the word `` conned '' -rrb- over two hundred thousand dollars from the good , trusting people of that city . \\n but a massive pay out from stone would round off his career . \\n he was getting no younger and he really needed a significant amount of money in order to disappear for good to the anonymity of the caribbean . \\n five million bucks would finance a very nice retirement plan . \\n jonas stone and mw had not met for a number of years , but they had got acquainted after one of the more unusual introductions it is possible to have . \\n as part of greenestone 's on-going thirst for investment opportunities , stone had been looking at the american prison system . \\n for years it had been a massive drain on state and federal budgets . \\n it did n't help that large numbers of prisoners were sentenced to terms that would far exceed their natural life-spans or to `` prison without parole '' . \\n the idea to put all of texas state 's prisoners for the next twenty years into private management for a single multi-billion dollar payment was one that needed investigation . \\n and three years before the demise of greenestone , jonas stone found himself in the usa . \\n it just so happened that on the morning of stone 's scheduled inspection of redville penitentiary , outside dallas , the inmates had decided that the conditions in which they were kept , were no longer acceptable . \\n the zero-tolerance regime imposed by warden carson de ath , at last , got too much . \\n the final straw came when the warden put up a sign on death row which read : go to your death with de ath . \\n the 3,210 convicts rioted . \\n cell doors were ripped off , electronic systems overridden and correctional officers chased from the buildings . \\n for twenty-four hours , the place became a no-go zone . \\n two guards were killed immediately ; more were taken hostage . \\n grudges were settled between individuals and gangs in the most brutal manner . \\n fortunately for stone , just as the violence erupted , he had stepped into the cell occupied by a convicted fraudster , serving ten years `` without '' . \\n stone had intended to discuss the inmates ' view of prison life with the man who had been selected by the warden as being a low security risk . \\n it did not look that way to stone . \\n the man stood as the alarm claxons blared . \\n he was not only much taller than stone but broader and more heavily built . \\n he moved with an athleticism , which hinted at his sporting past , to shove stone 's attendant guard from the cell , bang shut the steel door and ram the wrought iron double bunk against it . \\n the man turned to a quaking stone , shoved out a meaty hand and said : `` name 's mw , '' -- the second letter he pronounced `` dubbya '' , in the manner of the second president bush -- `` mighty pleased to make your acquaintance . '' \\n stone had no choice but to shake hands and mutter his name . \\n while mayhem raged outside in the corridors and halls of redville , and warden de ath and his men put into operation their ruthless plans for the recapture of their prison , stone and mw talked . \\n by the time the prison was , once again , in the hands of the state , mw had related his version of his life story -- which showed him in a much better light than the true version -- and insisted that he was wrongfully incarcerated . \\n any assistance that stone might see his way to giving him would be very well rewarded . \\n naturally , in the circumstances , stone agreed to do anything he could . \\n mw 's parting words to stone , as the guards banged on the cell door , were , `` i believe you when you say you could help me mr stone . \\n and believe me when i say , on the outside , i could be useful to you . '' \\n as he was marched at double time away from the broken prison , through the smoke , flanked by guards in riot gear , he reflected on the convict 's last three words . \\n `` i do n't think we 'll be investing in your prison , warden de ath . \\n though i may have an eye on another long-term investment , '' he told the beleaguered warden . \\n back in london , stone had committed time and money to finding out more about mw -- or mike wilkinson , as it emerged the initials stood for . \\n most people having gone through the ordeal stone had endured would have had nothing to do with the man . \\n but stone saw possibilities where others saw only danger or problems . \\n and the day and night spent in the cell with mw had shown stone a potentially prime asset . \\n with few qualifications other than a football scholarship , mw had achieved some local celebrity when he joined the dallas cowboys when he left collage , in the 1970s . \\n after only a few seasons as a line backer , he had sustained a serious injury which forced him out of the game . \\n he 'd lived for a while off his past glories until , inevitably , people started to resent his free loading . \\n he 'd drifted into crime -- some petty fraud , handling stolen goods -- but found the people he had to mix with distasteful . \\n he had eventually found his calling as a confidence trickster . \\n he 'd always been sociable and highly entertaining ; he could spin a plausible yarn . \\n a good-looking man in his youth , with a winning smile , for some years he earned a very good and highly illegal living parting the more gullible from their cash . \\n every time local authorities began to take too close an interest in his activities , he 'd move to another county with another story and worm his way into the hearts of his next victims . \\n over the years , the sketchy information stone managed to turn up , suggested that mw had scammed his way across many of the united states for much of his adult life . \\n his run of luck had come to an end when he had returned to texas and attempted to swindle an elderly couple whose daughter happened to be a police officer . \\n how was he to know ? \\n now fifty-something , it looked as though he 'd languish in redville until he was too old to work -- legally or illegally . \\n a bleak future awaited him . \\n a man like that might be very useful . \\n if only he were on the outside . \\n the opportunity presented itself about a month after the redville riot . \\n warden de ath was fired for gross incompetence and , in his place , warden william hope was appointed to oversee the reconstruction of the prison . \\n warden hope was a forward-thinking man whose mission included the reconstruction of the prisoners , too . \\n he saw the good in all god 's creatures . \\n all inmates , regardless of faith , were issued with a copy of the bible . \\n and stone took this sign from above to make mw beholden to him . \\n nelson bando and randy redhouse were small-time crooks on the streets of dallas when they were approached with an offer that , for them , was as good as a lottery jackpot win . \\n each realised that they would never have such a chance again in their sordid lives . \\n there was no question of them refusing -- which was just the way stone wanted things . \\n he was cautious enough to contact them through an intermediary so he could not be connected to them . \\n simply stated , the deal was to break mw out of prison and get him across the border line into mexico . \\n all the details had been worked out in advance . \\n succeed and they would each receive $ 50,000 . \\n cash . \\n flushed with the thought of so much money , the pair had exceeded their limited potential and , with a generous hand from lady luck , succeeded in freeing the wily mw as he was being driven back to jail from the sunday morning service at the little church of the babel brethren . \\n warden hope had been persuaded a few weeks earlier of mw 's sudden but deep devotion to christianity . \\n `` i feel the power of the almighty move within me , '' mw had explained . \\n `` i know i am a wretched sinner ; which one of us is not ? \\n warden hope , sir , i have only one thing to say to you . \\n the scourge of drugs has raised its ugly head in this here prison of yours . \\n it 's the work of the devil . \\n it may be that i have transgressed in my time but i have never taken a foul narcotic into my body . \\n i now believe it is my bounden duty -- a duty to god as well as to my fellow man -- to inform you of a conspiracy to smuggle in a quantity of drugs . '' \\n the warden had felt a great warmth towards this clearly sincere god-fearing man . \\n when the information supplied by mw proved to be accurate and the perpetrators apprehended , the warden 's standing with his employers rose and he chose , magnanimously , to reward mw . \\n `` what may i do to relieve the privations of your stay with us here , brother ? '' \\n of course , mw had played the part to perfection , asking nothing for himself . \\n `` merely the privilege of being allowed to comfort some of the sinners in the infirmary who have damaged themselves with those drugs . '' \\n how could a christian man refuse such a request ? \\n and , when mw , the day after a visit from a certain reverend bando , expressed his desire to worship at the reverend 's small clapperboard church , only ten miles from the prison , warden hope was delighted to grant his wish . \\n it was not an operation executed with any panache . \\n bando and redhouse had chosen a remote stretch of road and had stolen a buick pickup truck . \\n fortunately for them , the warden had allocated only one guard to his trustworthy prisoner , a middle aged man called alvin , biding his time until retirement . \\n he was driving the unmarked prison car when it was hit hard from behind and forced off the long straight highway down a slight incline and into the scrub of the texan desert . \\n alvin tried to prevent the escape . \\n he got off one shot , which winged redhouse , before mw tackled him , winding him and sending him to the floor . \\n the two crooks approached cautiously . \\n redhouse aimed a vicious kick at alvin -- both he and bando had spent much time inside and had little love for correctional officers . \\n mw helped bando wheel a brand new harley-davidson motorcycle down a ramp from the flatbed of the pickup . \\n he inspected it with obvious satisfaction . \\n it had been custom painted in silver and black and flew a pennant from a long aerial at its rear with the legend the rev of the 99 saints . \\n in one of the panniers was a change of clothes -- suitable attire for a biking pastor -- and a set of meticulously forged documents . \\n mw slipped effortlessly into his new identity . \\n as a man of god , the rev. dwayne dillinger , had good news to spread . \\n he wasted no time and , leaving the hapless prison guard to his gruesome fate , opened the throttle of the softail fat boy and sped off down the highway , the throaty growl of the twin exhausts audible in the still desert air for several kilometres . \\n alvin was discovered 48 hours later , prematurely retired . \\n by the time mw 's escape had been noted and the alarm raised , it was rather too late . \\n the revving reverend had powered his way along 650 kilometres of desert highway to the mexican border and , for the time being , was beyond the reach of american justice . \\n chapter seven the intrepid explorers returned to the hotel a little after six in the evening . \\n they met their father and mac in the hasselbaink lounge . \\n it stretched across the back of the hotel and out on to terracing overlooking a swimming pool complex . \\n wicker furniture , polished wooden floors with heavy rugs , and ceiling fans recreated the colonial past of paramaribo in twenty-first century luxury . \\n the reason for the lounge 's name stood in one corner , staring impassively over the small number of guest who occupied various tables . \\n the larger-than-life-size statue of jerrel hasselbaink -- aka jimmy floyd hasselbaink -- drew harry across the floor as a wasp is drawn to a marmalade jar . \\n `` picture , picture ! '' \\n he ordered his brother , pulling a chair from an unoccupied table to the foot of the statue . \\n he climbed up and slung an arm round the footballer 's shoulders . \\n will obediently pulled out his phone to capture the moment . \\n one or two of the hotel 's guests raised disapproving eyebrows at this unconventional treatment of one of suriname 's greatest footballing heroes ; the assistant manager smiled indulgently from his discreet vantage point but was quietly relieved when the two boys walked over to their father 's table and sat down . \\n one guest , sitting alone at a table well away from alan greene 's , but next to the hasselbaink statue , raised the newspaper he was studying as the boys passed , but not before harry had caught a glimpse of his bearded face . \\n harry had smiled conspiratorially at the man whom he took to be a fellow fan of hasselbaink . \\n the four of them discussed their afternoons while cold drinks were ordered and brought . \\n alan greene drank mineral water ; mac stuck to quilmes , a popular argentinean lager ; the boys drank coke . \\n greene was interested to hear what paramaribo was like : this was his first trip . \\n and he looked forward to being shown round by these two new experts the following day . \\n when their enthusiasm was spent , greene turned to mac . \\n `` we 're all set for friday , '' he told his sons . \\n `` aye , and ye 'll be fully kitted oot . \\n everything 's stowed away aboard the boat for the return . \\n i chose a fool proof model . \\n but she 's still got a load o ' power . \\n anyway , that 's for later . '' \\n he bent to withdraw something from a holdall between his feet . \\n when he straightened up , he smiled and said to greene , `` your toys 've arrived . '' \\n he placed a laptop computer on the table . \\n it was slightly smaller than the machines carried round by salesmen and teachers , and lacked a case ; it had a handle which slotted into a recess when not in use . \\n it was different in other ways , too . \\n it looked as though it had been built entirely from lego blocks -- it had a chunky , rugged outer casing -- and then sprayed matt black . \\n `` this wee one 's from the guys at hyper-systems , '' mac explained . \\n this was one of the companies alan greene kept an eye on as a future investment prospect . \\n mac had approached them with a request concerning the sipaliwini trek based on greene 's requirements . \\n `` ye 'd need to go a lang way tae break this , '' he continued , glancing at harry . \\n `` it 's built for the most extreme environments . \\n hyper want tae supply the army . \\n ye can drop it from a great height , stick it in water for an hour , bury it for a month . \\n nae problem . \\n they even claim it 's fire-proof . '' \\n he flicked a switch on the front of the machine and the lid rose to expose the screen . \\n `` twelve point two inch screen . \\n scratch proof . '' \\n he offered will the crimped top from his bottle of quilmes . \\n `` do your worst , '' he invited , nodding at the computer . \\n needless to say , the sharp metal made no impression on the screen . \\n mac went on : `` battery life : eight hours from a mains charge but , and here 's the clever bit : it 's constantly recharging through motion and , '' -- he tapped the outer casing -- `` through solar power . \\n one of the reasons for the strange look is because it needs a large surface area to gather energy . \\n the whole of the case doubles as a solar panel . \\n the wee bumps more than treble the effective surface area . \\n clever , no ? '' \\n he hit a button at the bottom left . \\n a pale blue glow emanated from the keyboard . \\n `` backlit , for night work , '' he commented , while tapping away . \\n the machine 's web browser opened on the web page of the glasgow herald newspaper -lrb- mac 's chosen homepage -rrb- , the day 's date displayed directly under the masthead , current news stories laid out in editorial order of importance . \\n `` wifi so 's ye can update youse facebook entries -- though i dinnae think that 's the sort o ' hot spots ye get in the jungle . \\n not to worry , though . \\n `` ye 've gps which is fully compatible with ... '' he paused and took a theatrical breath as he reached into the holdall again `` ... the satellite phone of the future , also courtesy of hyper-systems . \\n we 're to test this . '' \\n he placed the sleek implement on the table next to the computer . \\n `` this is no ' quite indestructible . \\n so be careful with it . '' \\n mac saw harry 's hand move instinctively towards his phone which he 'd casually left on the table . \\n it was a fully working concept design from a swedish boutique company which incorporated the latest technology . \\n `` that 'll be nae use to you once you 're in the jungle : no coverage oot there . \\n that 's why we 've got you the sat phone : important to keep in touch . '' \\n there was a pause . \\n `` thank you , macq , '' quipped greene . \\n `` after all this hi-tech wizardry , let 's look at one of the marvels of a bygone age , '' he suggested . \\n he unzipped a pocket on the side of a briefcase which stood next to mac 's holdall . \\n `` this is an m-a-p . \\n you may be familiar with them . '' \\n he unfolded a sheet of paper and spread it out on the table . \\n `` i know we 've got gps but a good old-fashioned map always makes me feel better . '' \\n he proceeded to highlight certain features on the chart which showed some detail along the suriname river as he followed it upstream from the capital to lake brokopondo . \\n at the south-west of the lake , the map showed the other section of the suriname river . \\n it snaked away through the jungle and , ultimately , to its source in the eilerts de haan mountains in the south of the country . \\n not surprisingly , greene pointed out , there was much detail along this important arterial route . \\n it was important for the surinamese tourist industry and for the country 's industrialists who transported much of the mineral wealth extracted from the interior along the wide waterway . \\n at the south-east of the lake , he pointed out another river flowing into brokopondo . \\n this one -- the ezel river -lrb- `` it means ` donkey ' in dutch , '' he told them . -rrb- \\n -- meandered away into the jungle in a slightly less confident manner , it seemed . \\n eventually , the map showed it rising in the range of hills surrounding mount machoulou over the border in french guiana . \\n but , for many kilometres , there was nothing but blank paper . \\n no one had had anything to add to the map and they 'd left it blank , as if in invitation , for others to complete . \\n both will and harry had the same thought at the same time . \\n they did n't really believe there were areas such as this on the planet which had not been fully charted : this was the twenty-first century . \\n once again , will felt a shiver of anticipation at the thought of going to such a remote place . \\n his father stabbed the map with a black marker pen . \\n beside the dot , he wrote `` apetina mine '' and circled the words . \\n `` there it is . \\n as you can see , we 'll have a lovely trip back ; lots of unknown territory . \\n this is right off the tourist trail . \\n we might have a real adventure . '' \\n mac raised his glass . \\n `` to adventure , '' he proposed . \\n the others followed . \\n `` to adventure . '' \\n like all good ma\\u00eetres d\\u2019 , the stuyvesant 's timed the delivery of the menus from the hotel 's mambo grill restaurant to perfection . \\n and , five minutes later , he the four diners sat down to a splendid selection of the best seafood paramaribo had to offer . \\n a considerate guest , passing the table where the greenes had been sitting , stopped to gather their glasses . \\n he quietly lifted the map , which alan greene had left folded on the table , and tucked it into his inside pocket . \\n he strolled to the bar , placed the glasses on the counter and , thanking the bartender , walked through the reception lobby and out into the humid night , thoughtfully stroking his beard . \\n *** `` first of all , the locals and those in the know , call it ` parbo ' , '' harry had informed his father , relishing the role of guide . \\n the three had left the hotel promptly after breakfasting on the terrace outside the hasselbaink lounge , leaving mac to finalise any last minute arrangements for the following day . \\n alan greene was more than happy to be guided round the city by his sons and he appreciated their enthusiasm and attention to detail . \\n it had rained heavily in the night and , while the heat had dried most things out , they had several times to skirt areas of localised flooding . \\n they wandered first through the city 's historic centre staring at the slightly down-at-heel but still splendid dutch colonial buildings -- their many verandas rising to second and third floor level -- built of wood and whitewashed or sun-bleached . \\n those near the waterfront were faring better as their owners were encouraged with government grants to spruce their frontages up . \\n mixed in with these charming buildings were more modern constructions . \\n some , evidently , had money behind them and rose above the traditional houses and shops , offering twenty-first century office space , clad in steel and glass . \\n others were more modest , built for a single purpose and slotted into gaps in the cityscape . \\n more often than not , they were low-rise stores or workshops , run by enterprising craftsmen or traders . \\n some would bring their wares on to the streets as wealthy foreigners and obvious tourists passed by , keen to relieve them of their wads of surinamese dollars . \\n at every set of traffic lights drivers would be assailed by men and boys thrusting fake designer goods through their open car windows -- perfume , cigarettes , watches . \\n they picked their way off the main drag , through muddy streets between packed houses , little more than shacks . \\n earnest faces peered from doorways and windows in clapperboard dwellings with rusty corrugated iron roofs . \\n smears of colour remained on the rotting wooden planks but , for the main part , they were grey . \\n there were signs all over the place of building going on . \\n parbo seemed to be in a constant state of change and renewal . \\n the shanties needed repair and propping up just to survive ; extensive preservation was being carried out on the magnificent legacies of the dutch colonial era ; and , where space permitted , the steel skeletons of new concrete structures promised much for the city 's future . \\n throughout the city , there were open green spaces and trees adorned the roadways , giving shelter and adding colour . \\n the brothers trooped round the main sights for tourists . \\n will thought it illustrated parbo 's laid-back attitude towards different peoples that the city 's main mosque and synagogue were next door to each other . \\n and the great cathedral of saint peter and saint paul was only a few hundred metres up the road . \\n its impressive twin-towered fa\\u00e7ade with its rose window would not have looked out of place in a small english town . \\n except it was painted yellow . \\n and made of wood . \\n it was getting on for two hundred years old and in the midst of much-needed renovations . \\n they were informed by one of the workmen that it was the largest wooden building in south america . \\n the vitality and vibrancy of the market appealed to all of them and they picked and browsed their way round the sprawl of stalls , many covered against the heat of the day . \\n there were leather goods -- wallets , purses , bags , hats ; spices ; cloth -- great multi-coloured bolts being cut to order ; heaps of fruit which spilled , here and there , into the squares and roads ; dried meats hanging and smelling sharply from hooks . \\n and people . \\n it seemed that all quarter of a million paramaribonese had turned out that morning to shop before the heat forced them to retreat for the hours while the equatorial sun was at its most intense . \\n they retired for refreshment at the foot of a short steep hill at the riverside bar which , as its name suggested , overlooked the great brown suriname river . \\n the sun had made the extra effort and had burned through the haze and low cloud to bathe the front in stark light . \\n they were on the outer bank of a bend where the river narrowed to only 750 metres across . \\n one and half kilometres to the south , the great jules wijdenbosch bridge connected paramaribo district with commewijne district . \\n they sat at one of the tables outside the bar , relaxing and enjoying the view . \\n a cutting in front of them allowed berthing for a few dozen small boats , many of them pleasure craft . \\n a road , with parked cars slotted along one side , ran down from the city centre allowing access . \\n on the other side of the road was a line of low metal business units , being used mostly for light engineering or storage . \\n against an older wharf on the main river , was moored an ancient fishing smack , its superstructure rising from the rear , a main mast to the fore . \\n it was , like paramaribo , rather charming but down-at-heel . \\n when the food came , it was good and hearty : traditional indian roti bread piled on one plate and a bowl of steaming clam curry . \\n they scraped up the green stew on to the bread and munched happily . \\n up the road , about a hundred metres away , in a dark , hot workshop , a man toiled away cutting templates from mild steel with a makeshift angle grinder . \\n he wore nothing but a pair of greasy shorts and a welder 's mask , the latter to protect his eyes and face from the fountain of sparks which flew from the grinder . \\n there are laws in place in paramaribo , as there are laws all over the world , to prevent people from hurting themselves or others by taking unnecessary risks . \\n the man in the workshop would have scoffed at such laws and , anyway , he had weighed up the risk of being caught and dismissed it as being vanishingly small . \\n he had had his angle grinder rigged up to his two-and-a-half tonner for the last four years -lrb- ever since he 'd moved his business to the dockside from an outlying suburb -rrb- . \\n the belt which powered the tools he habitually used , via a range of cogs and gears , passed the length of the workshop -lrb- encased in a wooden safety box : he was n't stupid ! -rrb- \\n , out through the front to the road where , through another short series of gears , it took its power from the rear axle of the man 's m35 cargo truck . \\n the truck was his pride and joy . \\n it was 30 years old when he 'd acquired it a decade ago . \\n originally , it had been built for the us army , had travelled across europe , served in germany and then , on repatriation , been sold off as surplus . \\n slowly , over the next fifteen years , it had travelled further and further south : farming in arizona ; a re-fit for carrying backpackers in mexico ; a minor role in a failed coup in panama ; rescue from a scrap heap in colombia . \\n the man who owned it now had no idea about its history ; he simply loved its ruggedness and , at its great heart , the turbo-powered multi-fuel engine which went on and on and on . \\n which powered his business . \\n today , however , he was not the only person in parbo to take an interest in what most other people would have passed without giving a second glance . \\n as the six-wheel-drive truck , with only the final axle engaged and turning , ticked over , mw sauntered past , noting the bricks stacked under the rear of the m35 . \\n precarious , he thought . \\n mw was not an old truck nut ; he was not an enthusiast for scrap metal -lrb- which is what was crammed on to the open flat back of the truck -rrb- ; he was not even considering his duty to report the flagrant breach of safety regulations to the local police . \\n no . \\n he was interested in the truck because it just so happened that it was pointing directly down the hill towards the cafe where the greenes sat eating , oblivious of the fact that they had been followed for most of the morning . \\n he crouched beside the cab , squinting at the angles and estimated the chances of success for the plan that had suddenly leapt , fully formed , into his mind . \\n was it worth the risk ? \\n mw had two choices , as far as he could make out : destroy the chances of the greene 's mission succeeding before they set off , or follow them into the foul , stinking jungle -- not a prospect he relished . \\n he made up his mind . \\n he 'd tramped round paramaribo all morning in the thick , sapping heat , having to keep a low profile -lrb- not easy while beating off the irritating locals wanting to sell some rubbish -rrb- and had not the slightest idea of how to accomplish his task . \\n until now . \\n he straightened up , satisfied . \\n the road was smooth and true . \\n his target sat distracted . \\n it could n't be more than a hundred metres to the cafe and -- he cast a look about him -- there were few people about so soon after noon . \\n he whistled a little tune , mad dogs and englishmen , as he stepped round the front of the truck to the left hand side . \\n quickly , he eased the driver 's door open and , with as little fuss as possible , turned the crazed bakelite steering wheel through 360 degrees so the wheels , which had been angled into the curb of the pavement , now pointed straight ahead . \\n chapter eight harry had stuffed himself with clams and was considering which of the appetising ice creams pictured on the wall of the riverside bar would finish the meal nicely for him , when he sensed a change in the atmosphere . \\n his father and brother were engaged in a discussion about the ship 's hull that could clearly be seen from the bank out in the river . \\n it looked like it had been there forever . \\n alan greene was trying to remember what he had read about it . \\n harry had settled on a confection which , judging from the illustration , would test even him , with its five flavours of ice cream , fresh fruit , cream and chocolate sauce , when the rhythm of the afternoon somehow shifted . \\n there was no way he would ever be able to tell how he was alerted to the danger . \\n perhaps , a woman 's frightened scream in the distance ; the pitch of one motor amongst so many others ; the yell of frustration from the garage at the top of the hill as the tools stopped working . \\n whatever it was , it saved his life and those of his brother and father . \\n he glimpsed movement out of the corner of his left eye , swung his head in that direction and ... time seemed to move into a different dimension . \\n all his perceptions became very slow and detailed : he 'd remember minutiae about the next six seconds with a clarity that would astonish him later . \\n bearing down on their little gathering , the looming front of an old brown truck . \\n the blind windscreen , driverless . \\n the engine screaming in protest at being forced to work at such speed in such a low gear . \\n the few witnesses of the imminent disaster standing open mouthed , looking at the scene , unable to cover their eyes . \\n and ... but then , no more time to think . \\n action only . \\n he hurled himself up from his seat , using the armrests to propel his weight forward with as much power as he could muster . \\n as he did so , he caught the edge of the light ply table in both hands and heaved with all his strength . \\n his momentum lifted the table , turning its surface towards his astonished father and brother . \\n he continued towards them in one fluid movement , turning slightly as he went so his shoulder rammed into the underside of the table and continued to push it out of the path of the on-rushing truck . \\n he was able to push both will and alan greene two metres across the pavement towards the front of the cafe , each of them spilling from their overturning chairs amid the chaos of plates and glasses and bottles that were the remains of their lunch . \\n if harry were fanciful he would have believed that the front tyre of the truck skimmed his hi tops as he completed his desperate dive for safety . \\n as he rolled over in the clutter and the rush and roar of the passing vehicle , he had no time to think as the umbrella that had been sheltering them from the sun , descended from where it had been thrown by the impact and landed on top of him . \\n the waiter , who had chosen just that moment to approach the table to take an order for ice creams , stood with a look of shock on his face and could only manage the words he had been taught to ask every customer : `` was everything all right with your meals for yourselves today ? '' \\n the truck ploughed through the rest of the seating area , smashing the flimsy tables and chairs -lrb- fortunately unoccupied -rrb- before mounting the pavement at the end of the road , snapping a white picket fence and careering across a piece of waste land which stood between the old wharf and road . \\n there was a slight rise as the ground approached the boards of the wharf which launched the m35 majestically on its final journey , through the air , through the superstructure of the old fishing smack and into the brown welcoming waters of the river suriname . \\n there was a stunned silence , a stillness , after the splash . \\n a number of astonished people stood , mouths agape , staring stupidly at the wrecked boat which was settling by the wharf once more . \\n greene laid a slightly unsteady hand on will 's forearm , reassurance for him as much as for his son . \\n he hoisted himself from the mess , pushing a chair aside and crawled over to where harry lay beneath the umbrella . \\n part of its mechanism had broken and it had partially collapsed . \\n greene pulled the folds away from his younger son . \\n the paleness of harry 's face could n't be concealed beneath the sun tan he 'd picked up during the morning . \\n his father helped him to his feet and wrapped his arms round him . \\n *** lucas perk was inspector of police -lrb- first class -rrb- . \\n he took off his immaculate peaked hat and dabbed at his forehead with a handkerchief . \\n he was having a difficult time . \\n it was not , as might have been expected , the foreign visitors to his city that were the problem . \\n he had checked , of course , that they were all right , uninjured and out of any further danger , as soon as he had arrived on the scene . \\n he had been called by the first of his officers to get there who , in turn had been alerted by the screams that had accompanied the m35 down the hill . \\n it was the mechanic from the garage whose truck had careered so hazardously down the street that was proving the handful . \\n or , rather , the mechanic who now seemed to have no knowledge of the truck . \\n which was odd , as perk had been told , not ten minutes earlier , by three different people who had popped up from their boats to help , that the truck which had so nearly ended the holidays of the three visitors , had spent the last two or three years parked outside the garage when not hauling scrap metal to and fro . \\n the subsequent argument had grown increasingly heated until the man had challenged inspector perk to produce some evidence . \\n he had asked the policeman to look all around and show him this mythical truck . \\n the opaque and placid brown surface of the suriname river was not going to yield up any secrets now and , judging by the rusting upturned hull of the ship which stuck out of the river , midstream , about 400 metres away , the truck 's salvage would be a long time coming . \\n the hull belonged to a 6,000 ton german merchant vessel , the goslar , which had been scuttled during the second world war to prevent her capture by the allies . \\n inspector perk , left the man and walked down to where one of his officers was taking statements from the greenes . \\n alan greene was trying to play the whole incident down ; the last thing he needed was to become embroiled in a lengthy investigation . \\n they were heading into potentially much more dangerous territory tomorrow and a trip to the police station to fill in forms would cast a shadow over preparations which had , so far , gone remarkably well . \\n will and harry were leaning against the counter of the riverside bar , the shock of the near-miss draining slowly from them , as greene pressed his point . \\n `` there 's no harm done , officer . \\n you 've got my details -- we 're at the stuyvesant , '' he repeated this information , peering over the top of the policeman 's notebook to make sure he had written it down . \\n `` we really should be off . '' \\n the young officer seemed to agree , at last . \\n `` we of the parbo polices , '' he stated in pretty good english , `` are unfortunate that this is happening . \\n we are not really in favour very much of the accident . '' \\n he smiled apologetically and saluted greene . \\n the word `` accident '' stirred something deep in harry 's mind . \\n the fragmentary nature of the memories of the few seconds before the truck smashed past them , played jerkily through the projector of his memory . \\n it was as though the sequence of events had been cut and pasted together in a random order in an editing suite . \\n he put his fingertips to his temples . \\n he knew , instinctively , he had seen something he now needed to recall . \\n think . \\n truck . \\n looming bonnet with the swirling reo logo of the manufacturer . \\n the shaft of light reflected off the flat pane of the driver 's side split-screen . \\n a boy -- eight ? \\n -- watching from the pavement higher up the hill , wide-eyed . \\n the whole sequence suffused with the scream of tortured metal in the engine protesting at the rough treatment . \\n and then , there it was . \\n in almost cinematic clarity , a crash-zoom up to the top of the hill . \\n something must have caught his eye in those brief , brief moments before he 'd launched himself against the table . \\n something that he had recognised . \\n then he knew . \\n he held the image in his mind . \\n beyond the truck , past the people and the parked cars , up the incline , a man watched the scene unfold . \\n there was nothing conclusive -- no distinguishing marks -lrb- how could there be at 100 metres and for only a tenth of a second ? -rrb- \\n -- but he somehow had the same attitude as the man harry had smiled at , thinking him a football fan , in the hotel the previous evening ; the same manner . \\n and he had the beard . \\n he wore white and a cowboy hat and a hopeful look on his face . \\n but harry was sure . \\n `` so we 'll leave it there . '' \\n greene was keen to get going ; he 'd also seen perk striding towards them . \\n `` inspector , '' he called . \\n `` i think we 're all sorted here . \\n we 'll expect to hear from you if you need us . \\n your man has all the details of the accident . '' \\n perk mopped his brow and addressed greene in perfect english with a hint of european accent . \\n `` mr greene , on behalf of the city of paramaribo , i would like to extend our deepest apologies for the shock that this incident must have occasioned you and your fine sons . \\n should there be any way in which we are able to make your stay in our country more pleasurable , it will be our delight to oblige you . '' \\n greene smiled and thanked the policeman . \\n `` well , i know where to come for help . '' \\n he noted the look of concern on the officer 's face . \\n `` hey , these things happen , '' he said , reassuringly . \\n `` and there was no harm done . '' \\n the policeman nodded . \\n `` i suppose so . \\n as you english say , ` accidents will happen ' . '' \\n as they left the waterfront , heading back to the stuyvesant , harry tugged at his father 's sleeve . \\n he waited until greene looked at him questioningly . \\n `` dad , '' he said . \\n `` that was n't an accident . '' \\n his father frowned at him . \\n will took an interest . \\n `` what do you mean ? '' \\n `` there was a man at the top of the hill . \\n i could tell he had something to do with it . \\n just before i knocked the table over , i saw him . '' \\n alan greene opened his mouth to protest , but harry continued . \\n `` it was the same man who was in the hotel last night . '' \\n `` what man ? '' \\n queried will . \\n `` the one by the hasselbaink statue ... '' `` i did n't see anyone . '' \\n `` well it was definitely the same man , '' harry insisted . \\n `` he was up the hill , dressed all in white , and i know -- i ca n't say how -- that he set the truck rolling . \\n maybe it was the look on his face . '' \\n greene stopped and scratched his head . \\n `` you saw a man -- european , yes ? '' \\n harry nodded . \\n `` near where the truck came from ? '' \\n another nod . \\n `` and you saw him last night in the hotel ? \\n are you sure ? '' \\n there was just the slightest suspicion in greene 's mind now . \\n he 'd been in business -- indeed , still was -- where millions of pounds were at stake over the details of certain deals . \\n it was not unheard of for rivals to try to sabotage carefully laid arrangements . \\n but out here in suriname ? \\n no , he reassured himself . \\n too few people knew about the expedition to the jungle . \\n he sought to reassure the boys . \\n `` harry , there are any number of european businessmen in paramaribo ; all seeking to seal deals , to make some money . \\n it would be surprising if we did n't see one or two of them around . \\n and they all wear the same thing in this climate : send a man from northern europe to the tropics and he 'll dig out his man-from-del-monte outfit -- you know : white linen suit , matching hat and sunglasses . \\n they all do it . '' \\n even as he placated the boy , he harboured a nagging doubt . \\n if harry were right and he had seen someone , it would be a little odd for a european not to render assistance ; at least to come to see if any were needed . \\n however , as they strolled through the streets , he let the warmth of the day salve any absurd worries . \\n the business of the morrow beckoned . \\n two streets away , the man they were talking about strode off trying to conceal his agitation . \\n there had been nothing wrong with the plan . \\n the gear had engaged the front axle -- there had just been enough of a delay to allow mw to withdraw from the cab -- and the front wheels had had enough purchase to ease the truck forward off the bricks . \\n then , there was no stopping the thing . \\n it had gathered momentum more quickly than mw would have believed and , trailing the torn belt from its rear axle , thundered down the hill . \\n watching carefully , he had been convinced that his mission was about to be accomplished , that he was about to become five million dollars richer . \\n then , before his eyes , the impossible happened . \\n with hunched shoulders and a resigned air about him , he headed back for his hotel . \\n this evening was going to be a lot more energetic than he had hoped . \\n the problem of the greenes was going to test him . \\n now he had no choice : he must go to the jungle . \\n the notion disconcerted him . \\n the jungle was an unnatural place for human beings -- certainly for this one -- full of dark , unnerving shadows , fast-running water filled with wrigglers and biters , and trees that harboured slithering , clawing , gnawing creatures . \\n even the air , itself , delivered attackers with stings and fangs , with scurrying legs and electric cellophane wings . \\n mw steeled himself . \\n at least he knew where he was headed , thanks to the map he had lifted from the table in the hasselbaink lounge . \\n the greenes ' destination was ringed in black marker and he had five million persuasive reasons to overcome his distaste . \\n chapter nine back at the stuyvesant , alan greene 's plans for a quiet night before their departure the next day , were interrupted when the receptionist handed him a slip of paper . \\n the hotel had taken a phone call while the greenes had been out sightseeing and dodging trucks . \\n alan greene read the message , a frown on his face . \\n `` what is it , dad ? '' \\n will asked . \\n `` i 'm not sure , '' replied his father , rereading the note . \\n `` a professor ajay ranmsundar , if i 'm pronouncing it correctly , wants to speak to me before we set off for sipaliwini . \\n he says he is a mycologist at the university of bristol and it is a matter of some urgency . '' \\n `` what 's a mycologist ? '' \\n `` i do n't know , harry . \\n look it up . '' \\n alan greene spoke to the receptionist who smiled and nodded . \\n `` what does he want ? '' \\n asked will . \\n `` i have not the foggiest . \\n i 've never heard of him . \\n but i guess we 'll find out . \\n he suggests we skype him if we get the chance . \\n i 've just asked for the video suite . \\n professor ramsundar says he will be in his office all afternoon . \\n what is it now ? '' \\n he glanced at his watch . \\n `` just gone four ; lunchtime in england . \\n let 's go find out . '' \\n `` hope it does n't take too long , '' harry muttered as he sought a definition for `` mycology '' on his phone . \\n he had plans for the evening . \\n there was a local derby kicking off at five o\\u2019clock at the nearby andre kamperveen stadium . \\n sv leo victor were playing sv robinhood in an out-of-season friendly . \\n football-mad harry thought it an opportunity too good to miss and his new-found expertise in surinamese football told him there was great rivalry between the two paramaribo clubs . \\n the video suite was housed in a large bright room off the main lobby . \\n the receptionist showed them in . \\n alan greene declined an offer of assistance : if he could not operate the equipment , then his sons would work it out . \\n there was a large monitor on a desk with a row of chairs before it . \\n he tapped in the number which was written on the paper and waited . \\n a dial tone sounded from some hidden speaker . \\n the connection was made and a voice answered : `` ramsundar . '' \\n greene had pronounced it accurately , it seemed . \\n `` hello ? \\n professor ramsundar ? '' \\n `` ramsundar speaking . '' \\n `` i though you could get a picture ... '' `` i 'm sorry ... who is this ? '' \\n `` i 'm sorry , professor . \\n i was talking to my sons . \\n this is alan greene . \\n i 'm speaking from paramaribo , in response to your message . '' \\n harry took the mouse that sat on the desk . \\n he activated the screen , resizing the viewing area . \\n `` ah , mr greene , i am very grateful for your call . \\n one moment . '' \\n the screen flickered and a face appeared . \\n `` would you mind switching on your camera ? '' \\n the professor said . \\n harry clicked the relevant icon and a smaller window opened showing the greenes what the professor could now see : the three of them sitting in a row . \\n `` that 's better , '' said the professor . \\n he was a man of about alan greene 's age , with dark hair , carefully combed into a side parting . \\n his dark eyes were intense behind wire-rimmed glasses . \\n `` mr greene , i am so happy i have reached you . '' \\n there was a pause . \\n `` and who are these two young gentlemen ? '' \\n `` these are my sons -- will and harry . '' \\n `` i am very pleased to meet you , if this counts as a meeting in this modern age . '' \\n `` what is it that is so urgent , professor ? '' \\n the professor 's face grew serious . \\n `` i understand that you are engaged in a project that will take you into the surinamese rainforest . '' \\n greene nodded . \\n `` that is the case . '' \\n `` and you will be visiting the sipaliwini district , if my information is accurate ? '' \\n `` right again . \\n you are well-informed . '' \\n greene was slightly guarded : he had not advertised their trip . \\n professor ramsundar must have sensed greene 's caution . \\n `` i have family in suriname , mr greene . \\n a legacy of indian workers shipped over two hundred years ago . \\n i have a second cousin in the interior ministry -- it helps to have contacts when you travel as widely as i used to . \\n when your name passed across his desk , my cousin , knowing about my work , emailed me . '' \\n `` how does what we are doing interest you ? '' \\n `` let me explain . \\n i will try to keep it as brief as possible . \\n i am a bio-organic chemist by training and i specialise in mycology , the study of -- '' `` funguses , '' interrupted harry . \\n the professor paused . \\n `` i prefer ` fungi ' , '' he said , `` given the etymology of the word . \\n but , yes , all types of fungi . \\n `` the path my research has taken over the last few years has focussed on the extraordinary regenerative properties of fungi . \\n i have linked these properties to the problem of neurological regeneration in mammals ; to be specific , to the repair of nerve damage in humans . \\n `` you will be aware that damage to the central nervous system through accident or disease is notoriously difficult to counter . \\n my research suggests that the chemical sequences produced in some fungi might address this problem . \\n i believed that there was , in all probability , a specimen , currently unknown to science , which contained such a sequence . '' \\n `` professor , '' greene broke in , anticipating what was coming , `` you can not expect us to look for a fungus that may not exist . '' \\n `` of course not , mr greene . \\n that would be absurd . '' \\n `` then what is it you want ? '' \\n `` i would like you , if at all possible , to find and retrieve a sample of a fungus that i know exists , one that , if i am right , will revolutionise the treatment of paralysis . \\n indeed , i am hoping that it will , quite literally , allow paraplegics to walk once more . \\n one moment ... '' he drew back slowly from the camera in front of him . \\n the greenes watched as the image on their screen revealed the professor to be sitting in an electric wheelchair . \\n the man in england paused for them to take in his situation then , using the joystick mounted on the arm of the chair , rolled back towards them . \\n `` you see my interest is not purely academic . '' \\n after a pause , greene asked : `` you know it exists ? \\n how ? '' \\n `` because i found it . \\n i held it in my hand . \\n i tested it for the chemical sequence . '' \\n `` i do n't follow . '' \\n `` a year ago , i was not in a wheelchair . \\n i was as fit and healthy as you are now . \\n a year ago , i was in sipaliwini on a field trip , looking for the fungus . \\n two things happened : i found a sample ; and i was shot . \\n i am paralysed from the waist down . \\n i fully appreciate the irony of this , '' he added dryly . \\n harry , who had been following the conversation with waning interest and surreptitiously clockwatching -lrb- he did not want to miss the start of the match -rrb- , suddenly butted in . \\n `` who shot you ? '' \\n he blurted . \\n greene was about to apologise for his son 's tactlessness , but the professor reacted first . \\n `` you know , young man , i believe when i was your age that that is precisely the question that i would have asked . '' \\n he smiled for the first time . \\n `` the answer is that i do not know . \\n as you may be aware -- and are about to find out -- the sipaliwini district is one of the most remote places on the planet . \\n i was not expecting to see anyone while i was there . \\n and , indeed , i did not see whoever shot me . \\n i speculate that there may have been some illegal logging going on and that i was mistaken for an official . \\n i owe my life to the pilot who flew me in . \\n he risked his own life to get me on board the chopper . \\n however , i lost the sample . \\n `` clearly , i am in no position to trek through the forest myself . \\n when i heard that someone else was headed for the same region i was filled with hope . \\n you will forgive me for asking . '' \\n `` no , no , professor , '' said greene . \\n `` we would be delighted to help you . \\n our trip is concerned with commerce , not medicine , but it would be crass to refuse such a request , if you think there is a realistic prospect of locating your fungus . '' \\n alan greene 's mind swiftly connected the proposal the professor was making to the wider aspects of what he was trying to achieve . \\n the commercial implications of a treatment derived from the fungus occurred to him , too . \\n `` we are planning to do some exploring while we are there . \\n if there is any chance we can help you , we will . '' \\n the professor 's gratitude was evident in his face . \\n `` that is very kind of you . '' \\n will spoke for the first time , excited at the prospect of such a noble undertaking . \\n `` how do we know where to look ? '' \\n he asked . \\n `` and what to look for ? '' \\n `` you are clearly a boy after my own heart , '' the professor said with a chuckle . \\n `` i have a detailed description of the fungus , together with a set of coordinates which pinpoint the location in which i found it . \\n additionally , i have a photograph ; the specimen is distinctive in its appearance . \\n however , its most striking characteristic is its smell . \\n crush the flesh -- especially that of the cap -- and it releases a pungent odour : sulphur and ammonia mixed . \\n quite distinct . '' \\n it was an unexpected request , but one that alan greene welcomed . \\n he wanted his sons to be aware of the potential resources that resided in the rich ecosystem they were about to encounter . \\n what better way than to search for something that might lead to an important medical breakthrough ? \\n he made a point of checking the professor 's credentials : the university 's website carried a brief and impressive academic biography of professor ajay ramsundar and listed his notable achievements . \\n as promised , ramsundar emailed details of the fungus as soon as the skype session ended . \\n greene was pleased with will 's enthusiasm for the added dimension the search would bring to their trip and , while harry hurried off to watch the football match , and the boys ' father retired to his room to make some calls , will studied the documents the professor had sent them . \\n if they were to be entrusted with such an important task , will felt honour-bound to know what they were looking for . \\n he viewed a series of photographs -- the fungus , taken from a number of angles . \\n the caps -- bluish-grey -- were the shape of elongated bells ; they sat on narrow white stalks . \\n some of the photos showed them growing from the rotting wood of a fallen tree , like little stands of pixie parasols . \\n will downloaded a couple of the pictures on to his phone then , as an afterthought , printed out a copy . \\n he folded the paper and put it in his pocket . \\n he opened a document entitled mpr -lrb- provisional -rrb- , which showed a careful and well-executed pencil drawing of the fungus . \\n the professor had labelled the drawing and , beneath it , there was a fuller description . \\n miraculum percuro ramsundar -lrb- provisional designation -rrb- . \\n the fruiting body of per ram comprises an ovate pileus on a long thin stipe . \\n there is no obvious annulus nor volva . \\n the presence of regular lamellae suggests that the per ram is agaric . \\n the labels on the diagram helped with some of the scientific jargon . \\n the `` pileus '' he deduced was the cap ; the `` stipe '' was what ordinary people called the stalk . \\n much of the rest of the description made little sense to will , but he scanned through it , noting the professor 's emphasis at the end about the smell produced by his new fungus . \\n a final document was a personal note to the greenes , thanking them in advance for their help and wishing them luck . \\n he included a set of gps coordinates and some advice on the particular habitat that supported per ram , as he referred to it . \\n `` should you be so inclined , '' he concluded , `` one of my lectures for my undergraduates , here at the university , has been recorded and uploaded . \\n it covers many of the basics of the wonderful world of fungi -- a sort of mycology 101 , if you like . '' \\n will had time and , while not really expecting to be enthralled by a dry academic lecture on a subject which , for him at least , had held little interest , he clicked on the link and gave the professor his attention . \\n one thing he had to concede after the first five minutes , was that professor ajay ransundar was a natural communicator . \\n the man strode around the dais from which he delivered his talk , and spoke with utter authority on his subject . \\n his hair was longer than it was now and he wore no glasses . \\n the cameras followed him , and cut away shots of the audience showed them laughing at the professor 's jokes and enjoying his presentation . \\n will , too , found himself laughing . \\n more surprisingly , he found the content of the lecture fascinating . \\n there was a surprise at the very beginning , as the professor delivered a little biological history . \\n `` two centuries ago , the first scientists to classify living things recognised only two kingdoms -- the animal kingdom and the plant kingdom . \\n quite reasonably , for the time , they placed fungi in the latter . \\n after all , they grow -- many of them -- from the soil ; and they have rigid cell walls like plants . \\n however , they make very strange plants , do fungi . \\n they are not able to make their own food as plants do through the process of photosynthesis . \\n they lack chlorophyll . \\n in fact , scientists grew to understand that fungi are more closely related to animals than they are to plants -- upsetting for some of the vegetarians amongst you . \\n `` now we know fungi do not belong in the plant kingdom nor the animal kingdom . \\n in fact , these hugely diverse organisms are spread across three kingdoms of their own : protoctista , chromista and eumycota . \\n `` and they exist in abundance across the planet . \\n a quarter of a million have been identified to date . \\n guesstimates for their true number range from a million upwards . \\n `` but let me show you . '' \\n ramsundar spent some time lovingly showing his audience a slideshow of obscure fungi -- slime moulds , yeasts , toadstools , rusts . \\n some of the images were of recognisably mushroom-like structures -- a stalk with a cap on top -- but displaying a rainbow of colours which would never do on the breakfast table . \\n many pictures showed organisms whose architecture seemed to come straight from the realms of science fiction . \\n then there were those which appeared to have no order to them at all -- a stain across a forest floor , for example . \\n and the fungi seemed to thrive in almost any environment , from the dry rot in the frost-bound timbers of a cabin in canada , to the moist , warm , dark spaces between human toes where athlete 's foot -- tinea pedis , to give it its scientific name -- flourishes . \\n as he drew to a close , the professor revealed that one of the contenders for the title of world 's largest organism was a fungus . \\n `` and this is part of that organism , '' he said , holding up a sealed glass jar containing nebulous blobs of matter which looked a little like cocoa-dusted truffles . \\n `` this is armillaria solidipes . \\n in the north-west united states , where i collected this little guy , it covers at least 2,500 acres ; that 's 1,400 football pitches . \\n it is estimated to be two and a half thousand years old . \\n that is one humongous fungus ! '' \\n will had often experienced the effects on him of excellent teaching : it led him to explore further . \\n if it had not been for the ultimate repository of human knowledge -- the internet -- will would have been one of those students whose natural home was in a library . \\n he relished the fact that , as far as fungi were concerned , he was now the resident expert in the greene family . \\n so engrossing was the wealth of information on his new-found interest that he was still poring over articles and videos when his brother returned from the football . \\n it had been an exciting game , according the harry , with the leo victor victorious , 4-3 . \\n it was the cue to join their father for supper before all of them got a good night 's sleep . \\n *** sleep was in short supply that night for mw . \\n his passage into the surinamese jungle was more irksome than he had anticipated . \\n he had collected a few personal items from his hotel room and set off , knowing his journey would take a lot longer than that of the greenes . \\n stepping back into the street , he hailed a taxi and snapped instructions at the driver . \\n away from the city centre were the commercial docks of parbo . \\n there , he would somehow arrange transport into the heart of the dark lands . \\n it was even harder and more time consuming than mw had envisaged and it was as dawn broke over the sipaliwini district that mw was finally able to slip into a fitful sleep . \\n this is not easy when your mattress is the hard duckboard floor of a 1960s speed boat that has seen better days . \\n his sleep-deprived brain tried , with some degree of success , to blank the buzz of the mercury outboard as it whined through the hull of the starcraft . \\n the boat forged its way up the ezel , dew glistening on its windscreen , the temperature yet to rise enough to dissipate it . \\n mw had had a rough night . \\n he 'd had a rough twelve hours , by his lights . \\n finding transport to go 400 kilometres up a river , only part of which was regularly used , into deep tropical rainforest , was not an easy thing to organise at a moment 's notice . \\n the vista which had greeted him when he had climbed out of the taxi , had not looked promising . \\n the milk chocolate of the river suriname undulated to the far bank , over a kilometre away . \\n that bank was much less developed than the wharves on which mw stood , agitated and still trying to return to a feeling of resignation . \\n logically , he knew , he had no choice . \\n the money offered by stone would lead him by the nose straight into the deeply forested areas of the country . \\n it took him two hours of wandering between the river and the warehouses and packing sheds before he found what he sought . \\n the smell of the place had begun to give him a headache -- there were noxious fumes from industrial solvents , the brackish odour of rank water moving sluggishly under the thin rainbows of oil slick that occur in any working harbour , and the cloying stench of fish too long out of the sea . \\n he had n't expected to be carried in luxury . \\n at best , he just wanted to be able to get to the mine , preferably before the greenes ' arrival , in order to investigate the opportunities which might be on offer . \\n he had no real plan ; he trusted to his eye for the main chance . \\n the boat , when he saw it , was the least bad option . \\n only about five metres from prow to stern , open to the elements and , despite its pressed aluminium hull , with rust stains down its gunwales . \\n but it had a chunky outboard and a skipper . \\n the man who owned the boat -- mahogany skinned with a shock of jet black hair which fell untidily over his face but was tied with red and yellow twine at the back -- gazed levelly up at the big american on the dockside . \\n mw wore one of his most winning smiles and casually produced a roll of dollars from his pocket . \\n they had travelled through the remainder of the afternoon , passing the trade craft which carry the interior 's natural resources down to paramaribo . \\n there were a few hardy and adventurous tourists who planned to paddle along the river in canoes , to mw 's utter contempt . \\n but the river was of such proportions that it may as well have been deserted . \\n at dusk , night fell swiftly , as everywhere in the tropics , and the boat had been forced to slow down . \\n the more measured pace seemed to bring the reality of the jungle closer to mw and he shuddered more than once , especially when they reached the point at the south eastern corner of lake brokopondo where the ezel mouthed its way in . \\n not as large as the suriname , he felt the leafy presence on either side of the ezel , despite being able to see nothing . \\n and into the darkness the boat went , remorselessly , kilometre after kilometre , through the chill of the night with only a weak-beamed searchlight to show the way . \\n eventually , just as the velvet black of the night had been smeared with the grey of dawn , mw changed into khaki shorts and a brown shirt , pulling on the walking boots he 'd brought from his hotel . \\n he wrapped himself in a blanket and curled up , as best he could , in the bottom of the boat . \\n before he dropped off , he surreptitiously drew a pistol -- a short-nosed walther p99 semi-automatic -- from the tote bag he 'd brought with him and was now using as a pillow . \\n the skipper , who seemed immune to fatigue , gradually increased the speed of the boat as the light grew . \\n and on they went , deeper and deeper into the jungle . \\n chapter ten there are more comfortable ways to travel into the jungle than on the floor of a speedboat . \\n harry greene got his first real whiff of the adventure they were embarking on as he stepped from the taxi at zorg en hoop in front of a hanger tucked away at the eastern end of the airstrip . \\n its doors stood open to allow the hazy light from the early afternoon sun to illuminate the aircraft that was to take them to the apetina mine . \\n it was an s-70 , not new , but in tip top condition . \\n sikorsky , the manufacturer , supplied a variant of this aircraft to the us military ; with the appropriate paint job and the addition of a pair of m60 machine guns , it was known as the blackhawk . \\n this one -lrb- unarmed -rrb- stood in the shade of the hanger . \\n instead of the dull , radar inhibiting matt black of its military incarnation , this craft had the green and silver livery of the charter company that had provided it . \\n nevertheless , it was an impressive beast . \\n the sight of such a powerful machine suddenly brought home to both boys the step they were about to take . \\n the thought of leaving civilisation and setting out through one of the wildest environments on the planet suddenly became very real . \\n few people had ever trodden the paths they would forge through the jungle . \\n and , at the back of their minds , was the knowledge that they would be beyond immediate help , were they to get into trouble . \\n their worries were partially alleviated by the reassuring sight of mac discussing some last minute details with a woman -- the pilot , judging by her headset -- as they checked the aircraft . \\n the introductions were swift . \\n the pilot , an american from florida , called mary-lou harper , had a ready smile and a confident air . \\n -lrb- useful in a pilot , thought will . -rrb- \\n as she went through the routine pre-flight procedures , will and harry allowed mac to deliver his last words of advice . \\n he would not be accompanying the three explorers : he had old friends he wanted to look up in paramaribo and , if time permitted , in georgetown , over the border in guyana . \\n he directed the boys and their father to a trailer which stood next to the chopper . \\n upon it was a boat , sleek , and sculpted to carve its way through waters of any description . \\n its silvery hull looked thin and light , but tough . \\n `` she 's a raptor , '' mac informed them . \\n `` one of the best boats for what ye need : a sled hull , d\\u2019ye see ? '' \\n he rested a hand on the front of the boat . \\n `` great in the shallows ; stable in open water . '' \\n the boat was about eight metres long with no superstructure , save for a screen to give the driver at least some protection from spray . \\n mac reached over and drew back the canvass which covered the boat . \\n in the stern a substantial outboard motor lay next to five plastic jerry cans . \\n `` all the gear ye need , stowed in the boat . \\n mary-lou flies you in ; it 's up to you to get yourselfs oot . \\n but dinnae worry : there 's only the one river . \\n ye 'll find it near impossible tae tek a wrong turn . '' \\n mac smiled to himself . \\n `` it 's what ye wanted , no ? '' \\n he consulted his boss . \\n greene nodded . \\n the boat was moored to the s-70 , the harness paid out between the two craft . \\n at that moment , mary-lou cranked up the twin ge t700 turbo-shaft engines which supply 3,600 horsepower to the rotor blades of the sikorsky . \\n further talk was rendered futile . \\n two minutes later , the chopper lifted off gently and took up the strain on the harness . \\n mac , one hand on the dangling raptor 's gunwale to steady her as she lifted off the trailer , raised his spare hand in a gesture which was half wave , half salute . \\n three greenes waved back . \\n away they went . \\n it took only twenty-five minutes for the sikorsky to reach lake brokopondo , ninety kilometres due south of paramaribo . \\n the great reservoir stretched for 40 km , north to south , and much the same , west to east . \\n mary-lou took them low and fast over the main dam they 'd seen previously only in images rendered from satellite photographs . \\n this was different . \\n it was a monumentally impressive structure , rising over 50 metres into the air and stretching , in total , 12 kilometres to hold back the waters carried by the river suriname . \\n the great lake behind it disappeared into the distance , its wind-rippled surface glinting like sheet steel in the afternoon sunlight . \\n along its leading edge and built into the dam was a series of concrete bunkers each of which housed one of the giant turbines which generated electricity as they were turned by the regulated flow of the water . \\n hydro-electricity was one of the alternatives to carbon-rich fossil fuels . \\n `` it was built specifically with the bauxite mines in mind , '' greene informed his sons . \\n `` that is a major factor in our interest in the mine here . \\n bauxite is mined all over the world but , in suriname , they are thinking about how it 's done responsibly . \\n `` they started this hydro-electric project forty years ago and , even then , there were environmental issues which had to be addressed . \\n i hope we have time to stop off on the way back to check it out . '' \\n as they swooped and headed off over the lake , the helicopter with the boat in its harness , cast an unusual shadow against the vast concrete wall . \\n greene gave the boys a little background . \\n the huge manmade lake covered more than 1,500 square kilometres ; it had taken six years to fill . \\n `` and such a large area of rainforest supported a large range of wildlife . \\n we think environmentalism is a new concept but some people have recognised the importance of looking after the world for generations . \\n the government organised one of the biggest animal evacuations in history . \\n operation ark ii , they called it . '' \\n `` do n't forget the people , '' mary-lou interjected . \\n `` five thousand people had to be relocated . '' \\n `` who lived down there ? '' \\n harry wanted to know , peering out at the dark waters . \\n `` people have always lived in the jungle , '' mary-lou told them . \\n `` there are still communities that have very little contact with the outside world . \\n they tend to settle near rivers and live using hunting and gathering techniques that probably go back to the stone age . '' \\n `` there are still people like that ? '' \\n will exclaimed . \\n `` there are still a few left , yes . \\n not like there were in the ` 60s and ` 70s when there were tribes discovered that knew nothing of the outside world . \\n now , they can leave if they want to . \\n some of them go to parbo . \\n lots stay in the forest . \\n they use modern materials , when they can get hold of them , to build stronger houses . \\n the modern world is slowly killing off a whole way of life . '' \\n mary-lou seemed saddened . \\n `` what about the five thousand ? '' \\n asked harry . \\n `` they had to move out . \\n whole villages , now under tens of metres of water , had to relocate . \\n they moved north of the dam , most of them . \\n they found somewhere else to set up and even took the names of their villages with them . \\n the biggest single move involved two thousand people ! '' \\n `` and all for the bauxite , '' greene senior added . \\n the aircraft made good progress and , looking down , the passengers began to see a growing number of islands . \\n these were the peaks of hills that still jutted above the lake 's surface . \\n the country here had , evidently , been quite mountainous . \\n the eastern side of the lake was a network of islands surrounded by choppy water . \\n there were white peaks on the lake surface as the wind freshened and storm clouds gathered in the sky . \\n the tropical rains threatened . \\n it was the western side that carried most of the river traffic . \\n the river suriname fed the reservoir at its south west corner and provided the main artery into the densely forested sipaliwini district for the industries that operated deep within the jungle . \\n it carried all the rich resources out of the forest and all the way to paramaribo . \\n any supplies , mining materials and workers went in on the empty ore barges as they returned for the next load . \\n alan greene explained all this to harry and will , along with the basics of bauxite extraction -- the methods used and the implications for the rainforest . \\n `` the most important thing is that the area that has been mined is returned to its pristine state once the job is done . \\n it 's no longer acceptable to leave huge holes in the ground . \\n we are perfectly capable of reseeding old mines and , after two or three years , the forest is as good as new . '' \\n will cut in . \\n `` but the media 's always going on about deforestation . \\n you know : ` an area the size of wales is lost every day ' . \\n my geography teacher bangs on about trees on land the size of a football pitch being chopped down every five minutes . '' \\n `` well , some of those statistics must be right , '' greene said , dryly . \\n `` and logging does as much , if not more damage , than mining . \\n but the point is , very rarely does anyone do anything to repair the damage they do . \\n and they could and should . \\n the logging , in particular , can be a massively wasteful and selfish business . \\n look down there . '' \\n he pointed to the lake . \\n in the distance , the boys could see a squat , ugly boat labouring across the lake surface . \\n behind it trailed a great swathe of something . \\n it took the boys a moment to work out that it was a huge log raft , dwarfing the tug which was hauling it metre by painful metre towards some distant sawmill . \\n there must have been thousands of tree trunks -- stiff , limbless corpses -- floating within a retaining chain held up by a series of buoys . \\n the trees looked like matchsticks at this distance ; the tug , a matchbox toy . \\n `` at least that 's slightly more efficient than the logging can be , '' greene told them . \\n `` they use all the mature trees they bring down . \\n a man with a chainsaw will take down thirty trees a day ; they have massive machines that take off the branches ; and the logs are then delivered to the river for transport and processing . \\n `` but , at its worst , the business is just stupidly wasteful . \\n but it makes sense from a business point of view , i suppose . \\n they go after the most valuable trees first . \\n down there , that means mahogany . \\n mature mahogany trees are few and far between -- maybe one or two per hectare . \\n once they find one , they smash their way through the forest to get to it -- sometimes , they use high explosives . \\n imagine the damage that sort of activity does . \\n not just to the trees -- any animals that happen to be in the area or up in the canopy . '' \\n the helicopter flew on . \\n the southern edge of lake brokopondo came into view and mary-lou heeled the machine over to follow the course of the river ezel upstream . \\n it flowed from the highlands on the border between suriname and french guiana , swelled by the rain that fell during the long rainy season which was just drawing to a close . \\n suddenly , harry , who had been peering out of the window , started . \\n `` hey , '' he exclaimed , `` that island is moving ! '' \\n will and their father moved to his side of the aircraft and looked down to where he was pointing . \\n obligingly , mary-lou slowed the helicopter and dropped towards the lake 's surface . \\n bizarrely , harry seemed to be right . \\n at a stately pace , a huge mass of land was drifting down the ezel towards lake brokopondo . \\n harry guessed it must be 40 metres long and half as wide . \\n it was covered in greenery , some of the trees stretching 20 or more metres up into the sky . \\n as she brought the chopper round to its intended course once more , mary-lou spoke . \\n `` when the rains come in the tropics , they really mean business . \\n sometimes , the sheer force of the swollen river just tears off a chunk of land from the bank . \\n the flow will have undermined it over a period of years , maybe . \\n and then , it just goes with the flow until it either gets snagged somewhere else , or gets broken up by the waters . '' \\n the three greenes watched the strange sight of an island drifting and spinning for as long as they could while mary-lou resumed their journey . \\n half an hour later , as it began to rain , they got their first glimpse of the bauxite mine . \\n from a couple of kilometres out , there was nothing to see -- the rolling forest unbroken , except for the silver snake of the ezel . \\n as they drew closer , alerted by mary-lou , they saw a space appear in the trees . \\n it was the same shape and colour as the image they had seen on the plane a few days earlier . \\n now , however , the detail was so much clearer . \\n it was a semi-circular clearing , the scale of which surprised will and harry . \\n the river formed the straight edge of the perimeter . \\n earth colours predominated -- rich ochre , ecru and yellow interspersed by seams of russet and dun -- and stood starkly against the green backdrop . \\n as they dropped closer , they made out the working parts of the site . \\n at its centre stood the processing plant , a great caged factory whose job it was to separate the ore from the earth . \\n it looked like the set of a science fiction movie . \\n enormous conveyor belts reached out like arms from the factory to take all the rock and ore that could be fed into its maw . \\n earth movers and diggers scuttled round , like termites , loading the belts to sate the beast 's appetite . \\n another belt conveyed the spoil in clouds of dust to be discarded along one side of the site ; yet another -- this one covered -- took the precious ore straight to the river , where one barge was just departing and another was preparing to dock at the larger of two jetties constructed on the west bank of the ezel . \\n downstream from the barges , the second jetty had a number of smaller boats moored to it . \\n ashore , there was the complex of living quarters and administrative buildings , next to which was a large h on the ground with a circle painted round it . \\n mary-lou eased the s70 towards the river , exchanging greetings and instructions over her headset with a soaked marshal who stood on the smaller jetty to see her safely down . \\n hovering over the water , she expertly brought the machine low enough for the boat slung beneath it to float close to the jetty . \\n a second man jumped nimbly into the craft , put a line round a convenient horn bollard and reached up to unbuckle the harness . \\n mary-lou pulled away and set the chopper down on the h . \\n they 'd arrived . \\n chapter eleven from a vantage point over two hundred metres away a grimy face peered intently through the sheets of rain at the helicopter as it touched down near the river bank and adjacent to the miners ' living quarters . \\n mw was crouching high above the area of the mine being worked . \\n he had an excellent view of proceedings below him and he was well hidden among the now-muddy piles soil and rock . \\n the southern edge of the mine was where much of the spoil was heaped . \\n thousands of tons of topsoil and stone , loaded with the nutrients which gave the tropical forest its rich diversity , formed a mountain range in miniature . \\n this was the stuff to be put back when the operation had exhausted the mine of bauxite . \\n the undulating heaps rose steeply to a height of over thirty metres in some cases . \\n the foot of the spoil mountains was contained behind a heavy-gauge wire mesh held in place between great steel stanchions which had been driven deep into the bedrock . \\n mw looked across the road which ran along the bottom of the hill upon which he crouched . \\n parallel to the road was the great caged conveyer which never ceased in its labours to carry ore to the river where it would be disgorged into the vast holds of the barges . \\n idly , he leaned against a large boulder . \\n it shifted , slightly . \\n he examined it . \\n an idea occurred to him . \\n at last . \\n he had had a wretched day and he deserved a break . \\n four hours he 'd been ashore in the foul , stinking jungle . \\n so far , it had been nothing but a trial . \\n first , the skipper who 'd ferried him through the night had objected when he 'd been asked to wait for mw 's return . \\n he wanted the money he 'd been promised ! \\n and -- mw got the distinct impression -- the demands appeared to suggest that he did n't trust his passenger ! \\n in the end , mw had firmly put his wad of dollars away and brought out the walther ; stuck it in the skipper 's face . \\n that got the message across . \\n suddenly , the man could not drop him off quickly enough . \\n mw had anticipated walking the last half kilometre of the journey . \\n he wanted to arrive with as little fuss as possible . \\n it suited his modus operandi to arrive unobserved . \\n he was able to enter the mine with no difficulty : security is always light in remote locations . \\n he walked with purpose along the dirt track which ran between the mine and the river . \\n one jeep passed him ; no challenge . \\n he strolled out on to the small jetty , noting the craft bobbing and moored to the wooden structure . \\n `` getaway boats , '' he thought . \\n it was only when he walked nonchalantly out on to the helipad that he was in any way confronted . \\n he switched on the charm as a man stepped from the living quarters , an uncertain look on his face . \\n `` bent u een van onze bezoekers ? '' \\n he asked in heavily accented dutch . \\n he was young and tanned , dressed in blue overalls , brown rig boots , and he carried a blue hard hat . \\n there was a logo on the overalls which was repeated on the hat : a representation of the globe resting in a pair of caring hands . \\n beneath it was the legend , zeeland mineral international . \\n a plastic clip-on badge was pinned to the man 's chest . \\n it identified him as aaron bock . \\n mw smiled broadly and said : `` spreekt u het engels , mijn vriend ? '' \\n the younger man smiled back . \\n `` yes , '' he said , his dutch accent still evident . \\n `` my english is very well . '' \\n he repeated his question : `` are you one of our visitors ? '' \\n all great conmen have one thing in common : an excellent sense of timing . \\n mw saw the chance and took it gratefully . \\n he extended a hand and clasped bock by the elbow as they shook . \\n `` i am that . '' \\n he placed a conspiratorial arm round bock 's shoulder and manoeuvred him into the lee of the living quarters . \\n `` i 've come to get an idea of how the company is running things down here . \\n decker 's the name . \\n say , can you tell me where i can find a guy , name of bock ? \\n i 'm told he 's the man to show me around ; he 's going places , that guy , they told me at head office . \\n very switched on ; knows all about the business . '' \\n as the flattery had its intended effect on young bock , mw expertly eased off . \\n `` but my apologies , '' he said . \\n `` i 'm keeping you from your work . \\n just show me where i can find ... '' he made a pretence of consulting a note in his wallet `` ... aaron , yes , aaron bock . '' \\n as he looked up , he noted with satisfaction the ill-concealed pride on bock 's face . \\n `` it is i , '' bock said , colouring slightly . \\n `` i am bock . '' \\n `` well , what do you know ? '' \\n mw enthused . \\n `` they told me at zmi hq that you could show me the site ; give me an idea of the set up . \\n i do n't suppose you got time to do that now ? \\n it 's just i want to get a feel for it without anyone knowing i 'm here . '' \\n `` i am delightful to show you . \\n please , my jeep . '' \\n and so , with little fuss and a great deal of front , mw found himself being driven round the apetina mine . \\n he did n't know what he was looking for ; just that he 'd know it when he saw it . \\n the words of the email he 'd received from jonas stone echoed in his head : disruption work and interference . \\n no one had said how he was to accomplish this goal . \\n stone just wanted to make sure that greene failed to settle the deal on the mine . \\n mw 's mind turned over the possibilities as they drove . \\n somehow , he needed to put an obstacle in greene 's way . \\n young aaron bock was a good guide and he did n't seem to notice that his guest was not really listening as he pointed out the control centre , which overlooked the entire mine . \\n he showed off the huge pit from various vantage points , detailing the purpose of each machine , showing off his knowledge . \\n he explained the way the grading tower worked ; the way the conveyors were controlled ; and the way in which the mine 's automated systems ensured as economical an operation as possible , delivering the ore to the barges at the jetty . \\n he drove mw around the perimeter , showing him the storage areas , well away from the living quarters . \\n high explosives are best kept out of the way . \\n he stuck to the speed limits on site ; no one appeared anywhere without his hard hat ; and there were notices everywhere reminding people of the stringent safety rules . \\n mw nodded sagely and complimented bock for being part of such a business . \\n in fact , much to his irritation , the whole operation looked wholly professionally run . \\n not much chance of an accident befalling alan greene , thought mw morosely . \\n mw should have smelled the first hint of trouble and slipped quietly away . \\n as the jeep pulled on to the loading jetty for mr decker from headquarters to inspect the efficiency with which ore was transferred into the barges , a large man , cold-eyed , approached them on foot . \\n he wore overalls similar to those worn by bock and a hard hat , too . \\n his was white . \\n it was his bearing that told mw he was a man to be avoided , if at all possible . \\n there was something about his manner that forewarned of his malice . \\n mw did not have time to take evasive action . \\n bock stepped from the vehicle and offered the other man a winning smile . \\n `` mr decker from hq is here to see how we are doing , sir . \\n i 've shown him most of the mine ; just the on-loading to go . '' \\n bock honestly thought he had done the right thing . \\n mw almost felt a twinge of pity for him . \\n bock doubled up as the big man 's fist plunged into his stomach . \\n the breath exploded through his face and he slumped like a shot dog to lie gasping and choking at the side of the jeep . \\n `` you compromise the security of my mine , i compromise you , '' commented the man , in low guttural accented english . \\n mw 's wits had saved him bodily injury on numerous occasions and his mind raced to keep up with developments . \\n there was a group of men -- overall clad -- some distance along the jetty showing only mild interest in the plight of their floored colleague . \\n the workings of the on-loading area continued without pause . \\n the big man strolled casually around the jeep , those cold eyes fixed on those of mw . \\n he wore a patch sewn on to the left breast of his overall which said general manager . \\n below the title was the name adolphus bolt . \\n `` who , '' he spat , `` are you ? '' \\n he stood looking down at mw who estimated quickly that bolt was a good five or six inches taller than him : closer to seven feet than six . \\n broad , too . \\n and athletic -- a boxer , maybe . \\n he looked about forty and the sandy hair that was visible beneath the helmet had signs of grey at the temples . \\n the face , hard and lean , was burned nut brown by a lifetime 's exposure to harsh suns around the world . \\n `` what , in the name of all that is holy , are you doing in my mine ? '' \\n the question was spoken with a quiet intensity that was , somehow , more sinister that a scream of rage . \\n the accent , mw realised , was south african . \\n it took all his nerve not to scoot over to the driver 's side to escape . \\n but , instead , he rallied well . \\n `` mr bolt , '' he began , `` i feel obliged to report your conduct to the board of zmi . \\n we are a modern , forward-looking company and , as such , are not willing to accept brutal treatment such as that i have just witnessed . \\n the rest of your operation seems to be smooth-running and professional . \\n i am , however , not able to turn a blind eye to a man deliberately attacking an employee . '' \\n he began to draw his wallet from his pocket and made a pretence of searching for a pen . \\n `` i am going to need a few details ... '' that was as far as he got . \\n as bolt grabbed him by the shoulders and lifted him bodily from the car seat , mw accepted the fact that his charade was over . \\n he was deposited in the dirt . \\n for a moment he thought bolt would assault him . \\n however , the general manager beckoned a couple of men over , explained something to them in a language that sounded not-quite-dutch . \\n the men seemed interested and , when bolt barked what where clearly a couple of commands , the men grinned , nodded and strode off , evidently in search of something . \\n `` all right , my friend . '' \\n bolt 's tone was far from friendly . \\n `` what is a fat middle-aged american doing in the middle of the jungle ? '' \\n he did not wait for an answer . \\n he looked critically at mw . \\n `` i 'll tell you . \\n you are quarry . \\n and you are in a quarry . \\n clever , hey ? '' \\n he chuckled at his joke . \\n `` i mean you are prey now . \\n when the boys get the rifles , the hunt begins . \\n there is no better quarry than a human : cunning , agile , tenacious . \\n but i have never seen a man outrun a slug from a proper hunting rifle . \\n when they get back here '' -- he glanced after the men he had sent away -- `` you are history . '' \\n mw , under any other circumstances , would have thought the man 's rantings were just that . \\n he would have dismissed the threat . \\n however , two things convinced him otherwise . \\n first , bock spoke again . \\n `` once or twice before this has happened . \\n in the transvaal when i was mining diamonds . \\n two intruders were apprehended . \\n great sport , they were . \\n i got one . '' \\n he cocked his head to one side in thought and a cloud darkened his face . \\n `` only once has a human evaded me ... '' then , two of bolt 's men emerged from a low metal hut , one carrying two rifles , the other , only one . \\n `` you 're not serious , '' mw finally managed . \\n `` it 's ... it 's inhuman . \\n people do n't hunt people . \\n the police will get you . \\n my people will send investigators . \\n you 'll hang . \\n you ca n't do this . '' \\n `` both you and i know you have no people . '' \\n bolt was implacable . \\n `` i wo n't do it . '' \\n mw was resolute . \\n `` i wo n't give you the satisfaction . '' \\n `` you will , '' said bolt . \\n `` it 's an instinct to run from danger . \\n you will not stand in the open and be shot . \\n i 'll give you some advice , '' he added . \\n `` i 'd get going now . \\n see those two ... ? '' \\n he pointed at the men approaching with the guns . \\n `` soon as they get here , you will have a five minute start . \\n i suggest you make the most of the time you have available . '' \\n mw could barely believe what he was hearing . \\n his bluster and bluff left him as the seriousness of the general manager 's intent sank in . \\n bolt was in deadly earnest . \\n `` it 's m-murder , '' mw managed . \\n `` yep . '' \\n bolt looked at his watch , unconcerned at mw 's protest . \\n `` you 'll go to prison . \\n you 'll get executed . '' \\n he was not sure whether suriname still permitted capital punishment , but it had to be worth a try . \\n bolt was unmoved . \\n `` no one will ever know . \\n they did n't find out in the transvaal . \\n this is even more remote . \\n this district is virtually lawless , my unfortunate friend . \\n you have five minutes . '' \\n the gun bearers arrived , looks of anticipation on their faces . \\n in the end , mw blundered blindly away towards the perimeter of the mine , through tears of fear . \\n he crawled under a wire , at the last second realising he had left his bag with the walther in it in the jeep . \\n the next ten minutes were the most frightening of his life . \\n using his five minute start , he managed to get far enough into the jungle to consider hiding . \\n the going was relatively easy -- there was not much undergrowth . \\n he thanked his stars for that until he realised that easy for him meant easy for his pursuers . \\n when he paused to consider a thicket as a hideout , he heard the sounds of the hunters . \\n desperately , he had thrown himself through the jungle . \\n but , no matter how hard he pressed on , the noises of the men behind him grew ever louder . \\n suddenly , the air cracked beside his head . \\n and again . \\n bullets . \\n the second time , the bullet scored a deep scar into the bark of a tree , sending splinters fizzing through the space in front of him . \\n a moan escaped his constricted throat as fear thrust him forward again . \\n shouts of frustration and some laughter mocked him on his way . \\n desperation gripped him . \\n he slithered down a small embankment , caught his foot on the root of a tree and pitched headfirst into a thick bush . \\n his momentum carried him through the foliage and over the edge of a large outcrop of rock . \\n for a long second , he fell , fully expecting injury or death . \\n he was too shocked and drained to cry out . \\n the three men with rifles were quickly at the top of the low cliff from which mw had fallen . \\n they had not seen him go over , that was clear . \\n they used the vantage point it gave them to scan the forest floor for some way ahead , using the scopes on their guns to seek their prey . \\n adolph bolt was able to peer a great distance through the trees . \\n he had mounted on his rifle a new swarovski optik scope with an objective diameter of 50mm . \\n effectively , that meant that a target 100 metres away would appear to be within touching distance . \\n advances in optics never failed to impress the hunter in bolt . \\n as he swept the area in front of him , he picked out individual leaves up to 300 metres away ; spotted the minute movements of birds on distant branches ; and caught the fall of a spider on its silken rope the length of a football field away . \\n all three men scanned the vicinity , concentrating . \\n `` gone to ground , '' grunted bolt . \\n `` for sure , '' one of the others agreed . \\n three metres below them , hidden from the reach of the scopes by a slight overhang of rock , mw listened , trying to control his ragged breathing . \\n the third man spoke , using the language which sounded dutch but was n't . \\n afrikaans , something in mw 's mind told him . \\n bolt responded in his native tongue and , it became clear , they were discussing a plan . \\n keeping his voice low , he repeated the plan to the english speaker . \\n `` he 's not far . \\n we 'll have some fun . \\n try to wing him ; bring him down . '' \\n their determination and lack of humanity drove a shaft of hopeless terror into mw . \\n he would die in the jungle , lost and forgotten . \\n it was not fair . \\n damn jonas stone for sending him to this hell-hole . \\n and damn alan greene for not sitting tight on the parbo waterfront , for having the gall to avoid the thundering truck . \\n something moved against his neck . \\n the soft loam , in which he lay , wriggled . \\n something slithered against his skin . \\n daring to move only incrementally , he edged his head round slowly to bring his eyes into a position where he could look down at his left shoulder . \\n a snake was trying to nestle into his armpit . \\n it was a beautiful vibrant emerald , its head , which was all mw could see from that angle , about nine centimetres long . \\n it was wholly involuntary but , nevertheless , the gasp that escaped his mouth must have reached the ears of one of the men above him . \\n a low harsh `` hush ! '' \\n stilled the other two . \\n agonisingly , mw could picture the scene above him as the men , signalling silently to each other , pointed to the edge of the rock on which they stood . \\n there would be circling movements with hands , one man directed left , one right . \\n down they 'd come , while one stood guard at the top . \\n there would be no chance for escape . \\n at best they 'd make him run while they sighted him in the cross-hairs and the bullet would bring him down . \\n mw nearly sobbed . \\n then , distantly , came the clattering whoomp , whoomp , whoomp of a helicopter approaching . \\n it was some way away but the noise had an immediate effect on bolt . \\n `` wait ! '' \\n he barked . \\n `` both of you ! \\n leave it ! '' \\n mw actually saw the booted foot of one of the men , not four metres from where he was trying to screw himself into the forest floor . \\n it hesitated , then turned and climbed to higher ground . \\n `` it must be the greene party . \\n come to see how we do business in the jungle . '' \\n bolt 's voice was full of disappointment . \\n `` they are early . \\n trying to catch us out . \\n come on . \\n we 'll return to this later . \\n he can not get far . \\n it will be interesting to track him . '' \\n the sound of the men receding from him was pure joy for mw . \\n the sound of the helicopter reminded him of his purpose in the jungle and of five million dollars . \\n he reached down and , with a shudder of horror , gripped the snake just behind its head and flung it into a bush . \\n chapter twelve picking himself up from the forest floor , having given his tormentors plenty of time to clear off , mw began to feel human again . \\n he had been hunted for real . \\n shortly before being plunged into a living nightmare , with an almost certain fatal outcome for him , he 'd been doing what he did best . \\n aaron bock had been convinced of his credentials , not surprisingly : the man must have known the mine was due a high-level visit . \\n mw really liked the feeling of power that conning people gave him . \\n the money was good , for sure . \\n but it was the knowledge that he could manipulate fellow human beings with his concoctions and fantasies which made the game worth the candle . \\n and now he realised he had never before felt such a feeling of hatred for a human being . \\n but the general manager , adolphus bolt -lrb- that name was forever seared into mw 's memory -rrb- , had he known the intensity of animosity directed at him , would have flinched . \\n his mind raced . \\n he knew he would need to get back to the river ; he would need to steal a boat if he were ever to get back to civilisation . \\n he steeled himself as he realised he would almost certainly have to go through the mine again ; run the risk of crossing the path of bolt . \\n if he were going to do that , it would be on his terms , this time . \\n buoyed by that thought and invigorated by anger , mw picked himself up and began , cautiously , to retrace his steps . \\n at least things could get no worse , he thought , grimly . \\n then the rain began . \\n sometime later , with nowhere else to go , mw had crawled cautiously under the wire which delineated the edge of the mine . \\n from a distance , the noises of industry -- diggers , engine gears and exhaust sputters -- carried to him . \\n they were muffled by the towering manmade mountain before him : the spoil piles . \\n mw was already filthy , covered with the slime and mud that the jungle had generated in conjunction with the tropical downpour which had just soused the land . \\n he thought nothing of climbing the dark slope before him . \\n he had no plan , no thought , other than to exact revenge on the man who had tried to kill him . \\n he just needed to take stock ; see how the land lay before him . \\n and now he found himself looking down at the mine . \\n he sat next to a small but significant lake . \\n the rainstorm had filled a depression in the artificial hills . \\n a massive weight of water -- a ton a cubic metre -- pressed heavily on the loosely packed overburden . \\n how many thousands of tons of spoil there were , mw could not tell . \\n however , he instinctively knew that the boulder against which he leant , acted like a plug -- a mini dam -- which stopped a catastrophic collapse . \\n as he realised this , he saw the jeep carrying his enemy , and the man he needed to stop , right into the path of the rock slide he could initiate with little effort . \\n he suddenly took a great interest in the speed at which the jeep approached and began to imagine where his landslide would finish . \\n *** as the clatter of the chopper blades subsided , it seemed the jungle answered this intrusion with a roar of its own . \\n a rumble of thunder rolled fatly across the site and the rain grew heavier . \\n a welcome party hurried the group from the helicopter quickly over to the quarters where the miners took their rest and ate their meals . \\n part of the temporary accommodation was set aside for important visitors -- executives from zmi , for instance . \\n greene and his boys shook off the wetting they 'd got as they 'd sprinted the thirty metres to the smart reception area which led to a comfortable room with office facilities and soft seating . \\n a man wearing shorts and a short sleeved tropical shirt greeted them warmly as they stretched their stiff limbs . \\n his face , slim and pale and adorned by a pair of rimless spectacles , did not seem to fit with the jungle setting . \\n his hair , too , was out of place -- black and waxed to perfection in an old-fashioned side parting . \\n he looked like a city lawyer , greene thought . \\n `` welcome to apetina on behalf of zmi , '' he said . \\n though he spoke with a neutral english accent , he pronounced the zed , `` zee '' , in the american manner . \\n `` i 'm harvey clarridge . \\n i look after the legal aspects of the company 's interests down here . '' \\n greene smiled to himself . \\n `` how do you do ? '' \\n he shook the man 's slim limp hand . \\n `` these are my colleagues , harry and will greene . '' \\n he paused as a look of puzzlement passed over clarridge 's face . \\n `` they also happen to be my sons , '' he smiled . \\n `` keep it in the family , and all that . '' \\n this seemed to satisfy clarridge , although he treated each of the boys to a moment 's hard scrutiny before returning his attention to greene . \\n `` make yourselves at home . \\n there are sleeping quarters with adequate facilities just through there . '' \\n he indicated a door at the rear of the room . \\n `` and , should you choose to eat alone , there is a fully stocked kitchen also . \\n of course , you are more than welcome to dine in the canteen which provides us with some very good fare . \\n `` may i apologise for the absence of mr bolt . \\n he really wanted to be here to greet you in person , but i 'm afraid he had to shoot off . \\n he 'll be along shortly . '' \\n clarridge left the greenes to settle in as the rain intensified , dropping vertically in great curtains outside the windows and beating an alarmingly loud tattoo on the corrugated iron roof . \\n `` well , guys , we 're confined to quarters for the foreseeable , '' greene observed , unnecessarily , peering at the scene outside where the dusty mine workings had been rapidly turned into a thick quagmire . \\n `` you heard the man : make yourselves at home . '' \\n the downpour petered out after only fifteen minutes or so and , as the last drops clanked metallically overhead , a vehicle drew up outside and there was a knock at the door . \\n before alan greene could move from his laptop , which he had set up on a coffee table , a man stooped through the entrance , a warm smile on his face . \\n `` you brought the weather with you ? '' \\n asked the general manager jovially . \\n he strode across the room to greene , hand outstretched . \\n he had changed into a smart pair of tan chinos and a blue denim shirt with the zmi logo on the left breast pocket . \\n for a few minutes , introductions were made and there was an acceptable amount of small talk . \\n adolphus bolt showed great interest in the boys -- `` i have a son your age back home , '' he confided in harry . \\n `` bernard , he 's called . \\n a good lad and a sportsman . \\n rugger is his game ; you play ? '' \\n harry nodded and they talked briefly about the upcoming lions ' tour of south africa which , harry had to concede , looked likely to go the springboks ' way . \\n then , as greene and bolt began to discuss the meat of the visit , clarridge returned , bearing documents that would determine , in part , whether the proposed partnership between greene and zmi would be cemented . \\n though he had introduced his sons as his colleagues , alan greene realised that the minutiae of business-speak would not engage either of them for years to come . \\n will and harry took the hint when he suggested they see whether mary-lou needed anything and went outside to get their first proper look at the mine . \\n fortunately , duckboards had been laid across much of the area outside the miners ' quarters . \\n both boys were spared the need to slop through the mud . \\n -lrb- harry was particularly relieved as he still had on his prized basketball boots . -rrb- \\n they made their way over to the parked aircraft and spent some time talking to mary-lou . \\n will , especially , showed great interest in the workings of the machine . \\n the pilot , like any enthusiast , was more than willing to give the guided tour , explain the fundamentals and share her experiences as a flier . \\n will had recently been up in a fixed wing aircraft -- a gobosh two-seater trainer plane -lrb- highly agile -rrb- -- as part of a post-gcse activity week organised by his house master at castlemead school . \\n he had loved it . \\n he 'd been given the controls at 4,000 feet and performed some basic manoeuvres before the instructor had shown him the capabilities of the plane . \\n anything agile that flew was top of will 's priority list from then on . \\n he was about to angle for a lesson in the sikorsky before mary-lou returned to paramaribo when his father and the mine 's general manager emerged from their meeting . \\n all had gone well and alan greene wanted a cursory look round the site so he might tally what he saw here with what was detailed in the glossy brochure outlining the environmental credentials of the operation . \\n `` it 's usually nice to walk , '' bolt was saying . \\n `` but after a sibibusi it 's not altogether practical . '' \\n greene queried : `` sibibusi ? '' \\n `` the heavy rain shower . \\n the local name is ` sibibusi ' . \\n it translates , roughly , as ` forest broom ' , as in a brush which sweeps through the jungle . \\n anything dead or weak or useless is swept away . '' \\n will and harry looked about . \\n though it had not lasted long the torrent from the sky had ravaged the landscape . \\n no longer was the mine a light tan colour . \\n now it was dark , almost black ; great gouts of mud covered the ground . \\n huge runnels had been created by the volume of water seeking the shortest route to the river which was now a boiling rolling maelstrom of white-flecked chocolate . \\n branches had been torn from trees and strewn across a wide area ; some chunks of land floated away on the river in vast clumps like the moving islands they 'd seen from the chopper over lake brokopondo . \\n `` i suggest we drive until the sun dries things out , '' bolt went on . \\n `` by the time we 're half way round , it 'll be back to normal . \\n that might be the last rain of the season . '' \\n he looked optimistically at the sky . \\n `` sometimes it is over by the middle of july . \\n `` but first , let 's get an overview . '' \\n he led them round the corner of the building and in through the entrance to the control tower . \\n a short flight of stairs took them up on to a viewing platform which overlooked the entire site . \\n adjacent to the platform was the glass-sided operations room . \\n bolt pointed out the salient features of the mine : the loading jetties , the piles of spoil and the great gaping pit in the middle . \\n a middle-aged man with a paunch covered by a checked shirt emerged from the operations room . \\n he had a large bald patch which he endeavoured to cover with strands of hair that he grew on either side of his head . \\n the result , thought harry , looked knitted . \\n he wore sandals and white socks which showed under his too-short trousers . \\n in the breast pocket of his shirt he had lined up seven or eight ball-point pens of varying colours . \\n `` ah , dr flavin . \\n so glad you could find the time to join us . '' \\n bolt turned to greene . \\n `` dr flavin , our chief engineer , is the brains of the operation . \\n he makes the mining methods used here viable ; makes it possible for us to make any money out of this pit . '' \\n greene and flavin shook hands . \\n `` doctor , mr greene and his associates are keen to learn as much as they can . \\n do the honours , please . '' \\n the engineer would clearly have preferred to have remained in his air-conditioned control room . \\n he dabbed a grubby handkerchief at the back of his neck as he began . \\n he voice was softer than bolt 's but the accent was the same . \\n `` what we 're after is the ore , which lies in layers several metres thick below the surface . \\n it used to be the case that the whole area would be stripped of anything that gets in the way . \\n that 's why it 's called strip mining ; there 's a clue in the name . '' \\n there was no humour in the man 's voice . \\n `` there were conditions placed upon our work permits by the surinamese government . \\n we had to develop a technique which would satisfy the environmentalists -- not that they 'd know we were doing anything different in the depths of the south american jungle -- and still allow us to make an honest profit . \\n so we strip back the forest , sell the timber -lrb- it would be a waste not to -rrb- , cut away the top soil -- which we store . '' \\n he made a vague gesture into the middle distance at the spoil piles . \\n `` then we dig out the ore : mechanical force and dynamite . \\n `` the conveyers draw all the aggregate to the hub which corrals the mix , performs a first phase sort ; it then delivers the ore to the jetty for dispatch and sends the spoil to storage points around the site . \\n the whole storage operation is designed so that when we come to replace and restore the area to its former glory , the right layers are put back in the correct order . \\n it is an operation made possible only through the use of a first class software program , designed specifically for this operation . \\n by me . \\n `` the last stage is to level the site and redistribute the top soil -- millions of tons of it . \\n then our tame biologists come in and reseed the whole area . \\n frankly , they tell us that it is not strictly necessary as nature would perform the task once we 've gone . \\n but , we give her a hand and the mix they use is based entirely on what was here before we arrived . \\n after only two years , the place is well on its way to complete regeneration . \\n of course , the trees take many more years to reach maturity . \\n but they at least have the opportunity . \\n and , in the meantime , the animals begin to return . \\n it used to be the case that the mining companies would just abandon their spent mines , move on . \\n the areas would remain barren if the crucial top layers were not replaced -- no plant life , no animals . \\n ` desertification ' , i think the eco-scientists call it . '' \\n when flavin finished , bolt showed them round the ops centre -- stainless steel , ranks of computer screens , what appeared to be a master control panel -- and then ushered them out into the heat once more . \\n they spent a few minutes watching the mine work from the viewing platform before climbing into a jeep to have a closer look . \\n bolt took the wheel and eased the car away from the buildings and on to the track which linked the various areas of the operation . \\n as they pulled away alan greene asked what was housed below the viewing platform : there seemed to be space beneath it . \\n the general manager muttered something about his personal living quarters and office , then joked that that was where they put the workers who did n't pull their weight and immediately drew his passengers ' attention to the radio mast which stood next to the control tower . \\n `` it 's the only way we can communicate with the outside world . \\n there 's no coverage for anything else . '' \\n will half expected the general manager to show them his office but , at that moment , there was a shuddering roar as an engine , deep within the quarry , burst into life . \\n `` oh , you really must see this , '' bolt enthused . \\n he drove the short distance to the edge of the huge pit , pulling up next to a sturdy guard rail . \\n will and his father joined bolt to look down at the mine 's workings . \\n harry , who could see from his seat , stayed in the jeep to avoid the mud . \\n it was only when he was standing on the rim looking down at the huge hole that will realised just how colossal it was . \\n the sight was impressive -- enough for will to put out of his mind the thought that there had been something evasive in bolt 's dismissal of his own quarters . \\n it was only an impression but , for the moment , the boy let it go for the next hour , bolt guided them round the apetina mine . \\n his method was impeccable ; his manner exemplary . \\n greene had not a single niggle of doubt that this man was running an operation which was both profitable and environmentally responsible . \\n the research he had carried out before flying to suriname seemed to have paid off . \\n bolt filled in the details of modern bauxite extraction ; of the exacting pains to which the mining company went to ensure that the jungle was reinstated in pristine condition after the final digger left , after the last barge moved downstream , when the small army of workers was moved to the next project . \\n `` zmi knows its responsibilities . \\n in the modern age there is no hiding place for environmental hooligans -- even in this backwater ! \\n look at the trouble the russians have had . '' \\n `` with their industry ? '' \\n will prompted . \\n he was keen to show that he was not just along for the ride on his father 's whim . \\n he had read about the eco-horrors the old soviet union had managed to cover up during the cold war era . \\n alan greene listened proudly as his son discussed with bolt the disregard moscow had shown for the environment in the vast hinterlands of tajikistan and uzbekistan . \\n whole ecosystems had been destroyed by the industrial pollutants poured into the atmosphere -- many produced by metals production . \\n worse for the people , had been the effects on agriculture . \\n grimly , ordinary russians had joked that their new national symbol should be a toothless , crooked cow , such were the deformities wreaked on their livestock . \\n and they were forced to continue to drink the milk and eat the beef from the mutant herds ; their children , too . \\n since the breakup of the soviet union , much of the environmental abuse had been observed and documented : great swathes of land , bigger than whole western european countries , were sticky morasses of oils and toxic sludge , sunsets stained to unnatural hues by rising gases , people in living hell . \\n and , of course , chernobyl , the biggest of the lot : a disaster that had rained radiation across much of northern europe ; too big to hide . \\n they turned their attention to the new methods of screening the ore . \\n ore could now be analysed at the point of extraction and graded according to its purity . \\n this meant that it could be loaded for transportation to the most suitable distant refinery , here , at the mine . \\n `` that cuts out the need for a whole processing centre in parbo . \\n reduces energy wastage , unnecessary journeys and keeps the costs down , too , '' bolt informed an impressed alan greene . \\n `` everybody 's happy . '' \\n harry peered inquisitively from the back seat of the jeep , while will leant forward to listen to the conversation in the front . \\n both boys were a little overawed by the scale of the enterprise . \\n their amazement grew further as the vehicle carried them down to the floor of the mine . \\n great terraces towered above them and they each had a feeling that the weight of the earth was stacked above them . \\n down here in the pit where they felt dwarfed by their surroundings , gargantuan trucks roamed like metal dinosaurs , the roar of their great diesel engines rumbling across the rapidly drying floor . \\n some of them looked like the indestructible toy trucks they 'd played with as toddlers ; but these were eight and more metres high . \\n their wheels were taller than the height of two tall men . \\n others resembled extra-terrestrial transporters with similarly giant proportions . \\n they looked perfectly at home in the strange , desolate environment and hauled themselves up impossible inclines spewing mud and dust from their wheels . \\n though will was as impressed with all the hardware as harry , he concentrated on the questions his father put to the general manager . \\n most he understood and could work out why an investor would need to know such things . \\n some -- and he made a mental note to ask his father later -- he could not fathom at all . \\n they left the floor of the mine and climbed steadily up the track which spiralled slowly back into the real world -- a world where they could see colours other than browns . \\n the vibrant and freshly rinsed green of the jungle sparkled beyond the perimeter fence . \\n they emerged on the side of the quarry furthest from the control tower , where they had started . \\n the track followed the foot of the heaps of spoil which towered above them to their right , great solid manmade hills , steaming dry in the tropical heat . \\n to their left , as they drove on towards the river and the loading area , the great conveyer rose from the pit and followed the track on the other side . \\n they entered the unnatural canyon between spoil heaps and corrugated iron conveyer . \\n chapter thirteen the first inkling they got of any danger was when a trickle of drying soil cascaded from the top of the mesh which held back the tons of earth and rock . \\n it was just a puff of dust ahead of them and about ten metres above them , but it alerted bolt . \\n something unusual in his perfectly run operation was always a matter for concern . \\n he stepped lightly on the brake , slowing the car . \\n he was the only one who had seen anything and now his eyes scanned the leading edge of the spoil heap . \\n it was just as well . \\n a boulder the size of an armchair appeared and teetered on the edge before crashing down into the roadway before them . \\n that got the greenes ' attention -- curiosity , not alarm , to begin with . \\n as bolt slewed to a halt , there was a look of agitation on his face . \\n as he stepped from the vehicle and approached the boulder , which stood stonily in the middle of the track , the look turned to puzzlement . \\n he stood peering up at the hulking pile of rock and earth . \\n the mesh restraint stretched up ten metres , and away towards the river and back where they had come from . \\n behind him , the corrugated wall of the conveyer seemed to hem them in . \\n the boulder blocked the way forward . \\n bolt suddenly cocked his head to one side , still peering up from the trap into which they had inadvertently driven and of which they were completely unaware . \\n he was listening . \\n understanding that they were not going to go any further forward for the moment , greene and the boys dismounted and approached the blockade . \\n alan greene moved towards the solid wall to their right . \\n it was n't quite solid , he realised , as he placed a hand against the mesh . \\n it was compacted behind the wire . \\n his sons moved to the other side of the track so they might see more clearly where the trouble lay . \\n greene 's curiosity changed the course of his sons ' lives forever . \\n what bolt had heard was the hissing rumble of a landslide . \\n to begin with , it had been muffled . \\n now , it burst forth from the top of the spoil heap . \\n earth and rock and water blocked the sky as it was launched by its own momentum into the space above the jeep , where it seemed to hang suspended for an instant before it hurtled down to fill the gap bounded on the far side of the track by the wall of the conveyer . \\n bolt neatly stepped round the boulder and avoided all but the smallest shower of debris . \\n will and his brother had been peering up ; saw the danger just in time to sprint the other way back past the jeep . \\n the whole thing was over in just twenty seconds . \\n through the cloud of dust kicked up by the fall , will began to search for his father . \\n harry joined him . \\n they found the jeep tipped on to its side and pushed back against the iron sheets which housed the conveyer . \\n there was no sign of alan greene . \\n instead , hundreds of tons of spoil lay heaped on the track . \\n a panic seized the boys as they began tearing at the rocks looking for any sign of life . \\n their efforts were interrupted when bolt shouted for their help . \\n he was over the other side now , crouching beneath the enmeshed heap of spoil . \\n the mesh had held , had done its job . \\n it seemed that the landslide had been caused by too great a build-up of loose overburden at the summit of the pile . \\n glancing up as he made his way to where bolt was cautiously lifting rocks , harry noticed the way in which a natural funnel had been created by the force of the landslide , just above the level of the restraining mesh , some ten metres up . \\n for an instant -- too fleeting for certainty -- harry caught sight of a man 's face , or what he took to be a man 's face . \\n before he could focus on the glimpse , it was gone . \\n in the strange world of disaster , it did n't seem odd . \\n harry 's mind stored the image in a backwater : a grimy , bearded , dark face , almost blending into the background . \\n could have been a trick of the light . \\n then he turned to where bolt had found alan greene . \\n he lay on his back . \\n unmoving . \\n he was partially buried and , as the boys approached apprehensively , bolt was clearing earth from around the bloodied face . \\n greene 's eyes were closed . \\n `` is he ... all right ? '' \\n harry managed . \\n he nearly retched in his fear-induced panic . \\n `` give him some room , '' bolt ordered without looking up . \\n he produced from his pocket a small walkie-talkie . \\n `` channel two . \\n emergency . \\n tell ` em what 's happened and where we are . '' \\n will took the device and was grateful for the opportunity to occupy himself doing something useful which distracted him for his father 's plight . \\n harry bent to help the general manager who muttered , `` careful , boy '' , and continued to lift rocks . \\n like his brother , harry was glad to be doing something rather than just standing passively by . \\n he reached for a large flat stone and lifted it . \\n there was a lot of blood in the space he revealed . \\n he recognised the pattern of the combat trousers he knew his father to be wearing , except for the shiny white nub which sat just above alan greene 's knee . \\n shock is a peculiar thing and , thankfully for harry , it numbed his initial reaction . \\n what he found himself looking at , what he suddenly understood , was that his father 's femur -- his left thigh bone -- had snapped and lanced through the flesh of the leg . \\n harry vomited . \\n it took less than three minutes for the rescue crew to respond to will 's call . \\n another jeep and a land rover , ignoring the speed limit , crunched to a halt . \\n men poured out . \\n one of them , carrying a small black leather case and a much-needed air of calm authority , took command . \\n evidently a man of medical experience , he squatted beside the still figure and began his examination . \\n the boys were pushed gently away from the scene , ushered into the land rover . \\n will recognised the concerned tone of the voices , the reassurances which were less than convinced or convincing . \\n through the numbing fog of fear and uncertainty , will 's perception became fragmentary : the medic glancing up at the general manager ; a shake of the head ; then bending to his task once more . \\n and will was transported back six years -- six and a half years -- to the beginning of the spring term at castlemead , to the dreadful day he has learned of his mother 's death . \\n the events before and after his grief-stricken father had arrived would never leave him . \\n it had been twenty minutes before morning break and he and his classmates were clockwatching , waiting for skinner watts to finish his lesson on life in the trenches during world war one . \\n `` no , steven , they did not have fighter jets in the trenches , '' watts said , exasperated at the questions he 'd fielded every year since he 'd become a teacher . \\n `` neither did either side have a tactical nuclear strike capability , martin . \\n -lrb- though , arguably , the stalemate would have been ended sooner had that been the case . -rrb- \\n verity ? '' \\n he sighed . \\n `` nor helicopters . \\n now , may we just get back to ... ? '' \\n the pause had been caused by the unmistakeable whump-whump-whump of the blades of a helicopter chopping at the air . \\n the coincidence had the class laughing and straining to see through the window . \\n the machine must be quite near . \\n and then will had known something was wrong . \\n he recognised his father 's aircraft , the registration number , as the german-built eurocopter 135 hovered above the school 's beautifully groomed hockey pitch . \\n slowly , the blue and yellow craft touched down . \\n it was sleek and new , the tail rotor distinctively enclosed in the fuselage . \\n will remembered holding back as all the children in his class crowded to the classroom windows to get a better view . \\n much more interesting than stale history books . \\n skinner watts bowed to the inevitable . \\n through the eager huddle at the window , will glimpsed his father stepping from the aircraft as the rotors slowed . \\n some of his friends turned and looked at him , smiles of reflected glory on their faces . \\n they failed to recognise the import of the unannounced visit : no mother . \\n will knew at once . \\n the message came from the head ; watts stepped out of the classroom to confer with matron , gave will a sympathetic look as he left ; a traumatic walk through a silent school to the oak-panelled office accompanied by his housemaster ; the final confirmation etched so plainly on his father 's face . \\n the details were made more poignant by the fact that alan and corinne greene had been celebrating their wedding anniversary on a dream cruise in the antarctic . \\n on the morning of the anniversary , they had stepped on to the foredeck of the small liner just as the captain brought the ship alongside the stunning and pristine ice floe at the edge of the weddell sea . \\n the larsen b ice shelf soared above the deck thirty metres into the cobalt sky . \\n timing is everything with accidents ; and corinne greene had been in precisely the wrong place at precisely the wrong time . \\n the structural integrity of the shelf failed and a slab of ice the size of an office block slid into the water . \\n the last piece crossed the guard rail and struck corinne on the head , casting her in the hypothermic sea . \\n she had been dead before the cold seeped into her bones . \\n there had been no tears , initially . \\n they came later . \\n harry , younger , had joined will and alan greene , the bewilderment protecting him from the reality for a few precious minutes . \\n then , with no other emotional response to offer , he 'd cried into his father 's coat . \\n his were tears of fright rather than of sorrow . \\n eight is too young to know what death is . \\n and now , were the two brothers to be orphaned in the remote jungles of south america ? \\n no one seemed to be able to tell them . \\n it fell to harvey clarridge , the lawyer , to look after the brothers while arrangements were made for their father . \\n he had made the right , though unconvincing , noises as the doctor had followed the stretcher bearers into the mine 's basic medical facility . \\n will and harry returned to the living quarters to await any news . \\n it was delivered by the general manager after an hour . \\n alan greene had regained consciousness , appeared lucid and was grateful for the painkillers that the doctor had administered . \\n while greene had been out cold , the doctor had done the best he could with the smashed leg ; had made sure no arterial damage had occurred and strapped the limb to a plastic splint ; it would need sophisticated surgical attention soon . \\n the head wound had bled copiously as head wounds are liable to do but , as far as the doctor could tell , the skull had not been broken . \\n however , there was a high likelihood of concussion and greene would need to be monitored for signs of anything more serious . \\n there were various lacerations , abrasions and bruises all over him which would be painful but not critical . \\n `` i guess your trip is over , lads , '' bolt had concluded . \\n `` your old man needs the hospital . \\n the chopper is the only way for him to get there . \\n we 've recalled the lady who dropped you here . \\n she should be here early in the morning . '' \\n `` can we see our dad ? '' \\n harry asked . \\n `` this way , '' bolt said . \\n alan greene was pale beneath his tan , the stark lights in the medical room emphasising his unhealthily ashen skin . \\n a bandage covered the top of his head and the damaged leg rested in its protective case . \\n he was propped up on a couch of the sort found in doctors ' surgeries , and a drip , hanging from a hook , fed into his left arm . \\n he managed a tight smile as his sons entered and gripped each of them by the arm in turn . \\n `` i 'm okay , '' he tried to reassure them , sounding far from normal . \\n there was grogginess from the blow on the head and from the pain-deadening drugs which flowed from the drip . \\n `` mr bolt tells me you two are all right , that the landslip missed you . '' \\n he raised his eyebrows enquiringly . \\n the boys nodded . \\n there was relief on both their faces . \\n `` so , a great start to our mission to save the planet , '' said greene with a weak chuckle . \\n `` maybe the planet 's trying to kill me . \\n i 'm afraid we 're going to have to have a rethink . '' \\n `` dad , all that matters is that you get the treatment you need , '' will reassured him . \\n `` mary-lou is on her way back and they 'll be expecting you in parbo . '' \\n the boys spent a few more minutes with their father saying nothing of any consequence until the doctor interrupted and gently ushered them from the room , explaining that the painkillers and delayed shock meant the best thing for his patient was complete rest . \\n will and harry walked over to the living quarters through the rapidly falling dusk and settled in for the night . \\n as they each privately sent up a prayer of thanks for the survival of their father , a shadowy figure descended from the spoil heap where it had been residing in something less than the comfort it was used to . \\n mw was stiff , dirty and desperately tired . \\n but he consoled himself with his new millionaire status . \\n most people dream of having more money than they have , more than they ever will have . \\n many fantasise about spending those untold , improbable amounts of cash -- whether in luxury car showrooms or in designer clothes shops -- and mw had had much of the afternoon to plan idly his purchase of a comfortable retirement . \\n the caribbean : a beach-side villa in a quiet area , nothing too flash ; not good to draw attention to oneself after a career like his . \\n mw had watched the landslip engulf alan greene ; he 'd seen the inert figure being dug out and carried gingerly away . \\n he knew greene 's foray into the jungle was over . \\n hell , his foray through life may be over . \\n any guilt mw may have felt was assuaged by the thought of those five million dollars that he would collect after one email to jonas stone . \\n he had no doubt that stone would honour his side of the bargain ; after all , $ 5 million was pocket money to jonas . \\n but , he had to get out of the damned jungle first . \\n his position looked bleak . \\n he was over 400 kilometres from anything approaching civilisation . \\n there was a man in the mine who wanted to chase him through the forest taking pot shots at him with a high powered rifle . \\n and he had lost all the meagre possessions he had brought with him . \\n he dropped from the pile of earth on to the track which had brought the greenes ' jeep to near-fatal disaster . \\n he was some way from the mess he had caused and which was now being cleared by a team of miners under arc-lights . \\n staying close to the perimeter fence , in the deepest shadows , he set off for the north east corner of the mine where the living quarters and control tower were situated . \\n there were two parts to his plan : find bock 's jeep to regain his tote bag ; and steal a boat to get him back to parbo . \\n chapter fourteen `` i feel like i 've lost something , '' will announced . \\n he was staring at the laptop screen only half interested in the information he had sought on the internet . \\n the words , `` compound fracture '' , were followed by the definition : `` a fracture in which the bone is sticking through the skin . \\n also called an open fracture . '' \\n there were two graphic photographs helpfully showing bones sticking through the skin . \\n will had already determined that the concussion his father had suffered was not cause for alarm -- `` with concussion , cerebral function may be interrupted but there is no structural damage to the brain '' , he had read . \\n the alarm and worry caused by alan greene 's accident had subsided but had been replaced by a sense of regret . \\n will felt disappointment . \\n the sights he 'd seen , the scenes he 'd witnessed , the colours , the immensity , the vibrancy , of the rainforest , all held a great charm for him . \\n he wanted to see more of it . \\n he had expected a slow cruise down the river ; he had been looking forward to the new experience and , in some way -lrb- and he knew it was unfair to blame anyone -- for an accident -rrb- , he was irritated more than he had expected to be . \\n his normal reaction would have been first to make sure his father was safe and looked after and , to that end , accompanying him to hospital in parbo would be the obvious course of action . \\n perhaps his father 's enthusiasm for things environmental had affected him more than he had realised . \\n `` harry , '' he called . \\n his brother was idly watching television on the far side of the room , despite the fact that the game show -lrb- a version of who wants to be a millionaire ? -rrb- \\n was being broadcast in dutch . \\n `` what do you want to do tomorrow ? '' \\n with a slightly puzzled look , harry replied : `` we 're going back to parbo , yeah ? '' \\n `` what if we did n't ? '' \\n `` i do n't follow . '' \\n will walked over to the tv set and switched it off . \\n he sat down beside his brother . \\n `` what if we do what we were planning to do ? \\n get in the boat and go back to parbo that way ? '' \\n `` will , '' said harry , after a pause , `` dad 's pretty badly bashed up . \\n he 's got a broken leg ; he 's lucky to be alive . \\n we 've got to get him back to a hospital . \\n the trip 's over . \\n we 've got to go with him . '' \\n `` what if we did n't ? \\n do n't you fancy a boat trip ? '' \\n harry still failed to grasp what his brother was driving at . \\n `` well , yeah . \\n but without dad , how are we going to do it ? '' \\n `` it 's downstream ; we 've got the gear . \\n mac showed us how to do it . \\n i want to go . '' \\n `` still ? '' \\n `` yeah . \\n we ca n't do anything to help the old man . \\n once he gets to hospital he 'll be well looked after . \\n and it 's going to be a few days before he 's fit to fly home . \\n we might as well use the time to do what we came to do . '' \\n harry 's face told the story of his thoughts . \\n will could plainly see that he too was disappointed with the way things had turned out . \\n `` you want to go down the river , do n't you ? '' \\n `` well , yeah . \\n but we ca n't . '' \\n harry a left space . \\n `` can we ? '' \\n `` listen . \\n this was just supposed to be the start . \\n a look at the rainforest . \\n dad wanted us to become part of his business . \\n you know -- business partners and all that . \\n if he wants that , we really need to do a little work ourselves . \\n why ca n't we do it ? '' \\n harry had no answer . \\n `` i 'll go if you will , '' he declared . \\n `` but will dad let us ? '' \\n `` we 'll ask him in the morning . \\n hey , there 's a great deal we could do while he 's laid up . \\n part of this trip is to check out some bits of the planet that have n't been touched . \\n and we made a promise to professor ramsundar , remember . \\n we need to search for that fungus . \\n if we do n't do it , it wo n't happen . '' \\n will developed his most persuasive argument . \\n `` the prof thinks this stuff is potentially amazing . \\n it 's got to be worth millions if it works . \\n just think how much it would be worth to people who are paralysed . \\n if there is any chance of finding it , we 've got to look . \\n he gave us the coordinates : we 've got to try . '' \\n harry brought to mind the argument often trotted out by environmentalists : the rainforest contains the most diverse range of plant life on the planet , much of it unknown to science . \\n it is said that there are likely to be thousands of species which contain properties which could be extracted and developed into effective drugs . \\n from the common cold to killer cancers , the answers may lie out in the jungle . \\n and now that the brothers were sitting deep in its heart , the possibilities came home to them much more than they had half the world away . \\n they had a very real chance to test the theory . \\n harry grinned . \\n `` i 'm in if you are , '' he said . \\n `` but you 've got to speak to dad . '' \\n he reached for the remote control for the tv . \\n `` if he says we can go , i agree : we find the stuff , it 'll be worth a fortune . \\n oh , and i want to drive the boat . '' \\n in the darkness beyond the open window something stirred . \\n progress had been very slow for mw . \\n he had exercised extreme caution in skirting the mine . \\n another meeting with that oaf , bolt , would prove fatal . \\n at several points mw had been forced out beyond the perimeter fence when , to do otherwise , might reveal his presence . \\n the two prongs to his plan drove him through dense undergrowth and across streams which fed into the ezel river . \\n sometimes he had been forced to squat motionless as miners approached his position . \\n -lrb- at one point he 'd nearly been urinated on as two men peed through the mesh of the fence rather than go all the way to one of the chemi-loos dotted about the mine . -rrb- \\n when he finally made it to the corner of the site where the accommodation block and the control tower were located , he was relieved to note that bock 's jeep was parked away from the floodlit area at the front of the block among several other vehicles . \\n caution should still be the watchword but , with any luck , his tote bag would still be in the foot well between the passenger seat and the rear seats . \\n he watched and waited and , using the side of the accommodation block for cover , edged forward , keeping low . \\n a few windows overlooked the waste ground which he needed to cross . \\n all but one were darkened and shut . \\n he approached the open one , its light splashing on to the brown dirt beneath it , planning to flatten himself against the wall and slide below it , quietly , carefully , and be gone . \\n voices drifted through the opening . \\n words which would always interest mw : `` worth millions ... a fortune ... '' he paused and listened intently . \\n it was the two boys : greene 's sons . \\n what were they talking about ? \\n two minutes later he revised his twin-pronged plan , adding a third requirement . \\n after getting the bag -lrb- with the gun -rrb- and stealing a boat , he would delay his flight from the jungle just long enough to relieve the brothers of their valuable fungus . \\n they may not know much about the value of new drugs ; but he did . \\n effective ones were worth not millions , but billions . \\n and for that sort of money , mw could put up with a few more days ' discomfort . \\n *** neither will nor harry expected their father to agree so readily to allow his teenage sons free rein on a remote stretch of a wild river running through virgin rainforest in the darkest depths of a country they 'd not heard of a week ago . \\n but he did . \\n maybe it was the rap he had taken on his head . \\n they stood watching the winking lights on the underside of mary-lou 's sikorsky as it disappeared into the grey dawn . \\n alone now , will felt the vastness of the sipaliwini district around him . \\n not only had he to get himself across the inhospitable terrain which had been so easily negotiated by air and which looked so innocent and benign from 500 metres above the canopy , he also had responsibility for his brother . \\n and for the ultimate success or failure of the expedition . \\n quite apart from that concern , he harboured doubts about his ability to operate a boat he 'd never tried before . \\n perhaps he would let his brother drive . \\n the words of his father sounded in his head as the rotor blades ' clatter receded : `` finish the inspection . \\n always finish the job . \\n and be thorough . '' \\n it had been the clearest part of the meeting before greene had been strapped into the cabin of the helicopter . \\n later , will would realise that his father had not been at his most lucid ; the shock of the injuries , the concussion itself and the drugs that had been administered , all added to his state . \\n and , probably , hastened his decision to let the boys go . \\n before that , will had stated his case : `` too far to come to stop halfway through ... plenty of equipment and advice from mac ... and we 've both been looking forward to it . '' \\n a proud smile had spread across alan greene 's face and he 'd nodded his consent . \\n `` it 'd be a shame to waste all that preparation . \\n i 'll see you in parbo in three or four days . '' \\n that had been that . \\n will turned as the chopper 's engines faded to nothing . \\n in the dawn light , he caught sight of bolt conferring with clarridge some way off in the doorway of the canteen . \\n it was clear from their glances and gestures they were discussing the greene boys . \\n angry words were being exchanged , though both men , for the sake of appearances , were trying to temper their ire . \\n finally , bolt broke away from the other man and strode over to where the boys were standing . \\n there was a grim look on his face . \\n harry had his back to bolt . \\n he was fiddling with the sat phone , absently turning the frequency locator and pushing the aerial in and out . \\n when bolt barked at them , harry , startled , dropped it to the ground . \\n `` right , you two : your father has left you instructions to complete the survey of my mine . \\n the lawyer '' -- he motioned with his head to where clarridge stood and spat the word -- `` says you have every right to traipse across my operation sticking your noses in . \\n i think you are just getting in the way . \\n what do you know about mining ? \\n nothing . '' \\n he was close enough to will for the boy to smell the beer on his breath from the night before . \\n as harry stooped to retrieve the phone , the general manager 's temper boiled . \\n `` listen to me , boy ! '' \\n he snapped , kicking the phone away . \\n `` i 'm speaking ! \\n `` here 's the deal : you have three hours to check what you want , pack up and get off down river . \\n i have work to do . \\n my mine wo n't run itself and it 's not equipped with a kindergarten . '' \\n `` you do n't need to worry about us , mr bolt , '' harry asserted , looking levelly at the man . \\n `` we 'll finish off and get going , wo n't we , will ? '' \\n will held the hostile gaze of the general manager , wondering why he had become suddenly so obstructive and unhelpful . \\n `` yes , '' he said slowly . \\n `` we 'll head off just as soon as we have finished the job our father asked us to complete . '' \\n he hated bullies , had known a few at school . \\n he recognised the mean streak which cut through bolt . \\n `` and i believe it is not your mine . \\n you manage it for zmi . '' \\n as he had expected , the jibe hit home . \\n the general manager flushed an angry red and was about to react when clarridge arrived . \\n clarridge had seen the clash between the man and the boys and moved to ensure nothing too untoward occurred . \\n `` mr bolt , '' he announced , `` has asked me to make sure you two are able to see what you wish to see before you leave . '' \\n he looked obsequiously at the general manager who was still trying to marshal his emotions . \\n `` you understand that he has an awful lot to do . \\n indeed , a whole mining operation to run . '' \\n bolt sniffed derisively , turned on his heal and stalked away . \\n will knew that he should not have goaded bolt but the man 's attitude was so unnecessary . \\n quietly , he hoped there would be no comebacks . \\n `` under a lot of pressure , '' explained clarridge . \\n `` now , where would you like to begin ? '' \\n `` we 'd like to begin with a working phone , '' harry muttered . \\n he had picked up the sat phone . \\n `` this is broken . '' \\n he twisted the on/off knob several times ; the screen remained stubbornly blank . \\n will took it to see for himself . \\n `` it might just be the knock it took ; give it a while and we 'll see . '' \\n he hated the idea of the phone being totalled : that would be a pretty robust argument for the cancellation of the trip . \\n if clarridge got wind of it , he might call parbo and get them airlifted . \\n will pocketed it . \\n `` s\\u2019okay , '' he said . \\n he would have preferred to have had a means of communication , for emergency . \\n who would n't ? \\n however , his heart was set on the trip and , he reasoned , even with a phone , there was no swift way to summon help should it be needed . \\n even if mac were on permanent standby , it would take him several hours to reach them from parbo ; and then only if they were able to give him a precise fix on their location . \\n he turned and smiled reassuringly at the lawyer . \\n `` let 's go , '' he said . \\n chapter fifteen for much of the rest of the morning , the brothers had been accompanied by clarridge to those areas of the mine that they 'd failed to see the previous day . \\n they had driven round the perimeter , anticlockwise , finally coming to the point where the landslip had taken place just eighteen hours earlier . \\n there was no sign of the debris . \\n it is astonishing how quickly rubble can be moved with the right equipment . \\n for some reason , clarridge felt compelled to comment on the near disaster which had taken place the day before . \\n of course , he had no knowledge of the presence of an american conman on top of the spoil pile . \\n and he had swallowed bolt 's curt explanation of the landslip . \\n `` the sibibusi certainly swept the top of that pile , '' he joked weakly . \\n `` it was just unfortunate that your father was beneath the slip . \\n totally unforeseeable ; a chance in a million . '' \\n his lawyer 's mind sought to play down any chance of legal action . \\n clarridge 's demeanour changed abruptly . \\n he dropped his voice and asked the brothers whether they minded if he were to disappear for a while to attend to some business . \\n will and harry were quietly delighted to be rid of their chaperone . \\n they moved to the output end of the mine . \\n this was where the valuable raw materials were loaded on to the barges which laboured downstream for 400 km , all the way to the refining plants south of parbo . \\n computer controlled gantries selected the ore for certain holds , based on the calculations made at the grading plant , by dr flavin 's software ; this ensured the different gradations of ore were delivered to appropriate areas of the refining facilities . \\n costs were minimised as was environmental impact . \\n these details of the operation and the efficiency with which they were effected were noted by the boys . \\n they found themselves at the perimeter fence beside the river . \\n it was remarkable how immediate the jungle was . \\n on their side of the fence , the boys saw only dried earth and gravel which had been laid in an attempt to prevent the jungle encroaching . \\n on the other side of the mesh , the greenery came right up to the wire as though waiting to reclaim its territory . \\n part of the fence , where it met the river , had been damaged , maybe by the sibibusi-swollen water . \\n will was able to step round it . \\n he felt the urge to see more of the jungle and beckoned harry . \\n the pair pushed through the undergrowth away from the mine and , almost at once , found themselves enveloped by trees and bushes . \\n if it were not for the industrial noises drifting after them from the heavy machinery of mining , they could have been in the middle of nowhere . \\n they spent some time examining the forest flora , most of it new to them . \\n they started to get a sense of the way in which everything in this great ecosystem had its own part to play ; that all the plant life , from the smallest shrub to the tallest tree , had its place in the hierarchy . \\n each of the plants had evolved over millions of years to make the most of its niche . \\n will had learned about the concept of ecosystems at castlemead , but actually standing in the midst of system gave him an altogether greater insight . \\n harry was on his knees looking for signs of animal life . \\n all he had found so far was a spider 's nest -- the silk around the entrance gave it away . \\n he was poking it with a stick , trying , unsuccessfully , to persuade the occupant to reveal itself . \\n will was quite relieved that some great arachnid behemoth failed to show as he leaned against a tree . \\n he was startled as the trunk , a stout thirty centimetres across , gave under his weight . \\n puzzled , he examined it . \\n around the base , was a ring of toadstools with broad slightly concave caps -lrb- pileus : he reminded himself of the scientific name for the cap -rrb- . \\n they clustered together across the forest floor like tawny reptilian scales and encroached on the foot of the tree . \\n this was professor ramsundar 's lecture brought of life . \\n he knew exactly what he was looking at : honey fungus . \\n he had seen it on one of the professor 's slides and recalled what the professor had told his students . \\n an idea occurred to him . \\n `` harry . \\n you 're looking a little pale , '' he told his brother . \\n `` i 'm not sure you can take the stress of this trip . '' \\n harry looked up from his spider-baiting . \\n `` what ? '' \\n `` you 're looking quite weak and feeble . \\n perhaps we 'd better call the whole thing off . '' \\n `` what are you on about ? '' \\n `` i 've got a responsibility to dad to make sure you are up for the boat trip . \\n i 've got to take that seriously and you seem a little weak . '' \\n `` weak ! '' \\n exclaimed harry . \\n `` anything you can do , i can do . '' \\n `` okay , '' will responded as harry walked into his trap . \\n `` prove it . '' \\n `` what have you got in mind ? '' \\n `` a bet . '' \\n `` what ? '' \\n harry was standing beside his brother now , bristling with indignation . \\n he was n't going to be the reason for the end of the trip . \\n `` a test of strength , '' his brother said . \\n `` i 'm as strong as you , '' harry retorted . \\n he was n't quite , but that was not the point . \\n `` okay , '' said will . \\n `` push over a tree . '' \\n `` a tree ? '' \\n `` yes ; a tree . '' \\n harry had no idea what nonsense his brother was up to . \\n `` you push over a tree . '' \\n will made a show of loosening up his muscles ; then of selecting a suitable target for his show of strength . \\n `` i think this one will do . '' \\n `` yeah , right , '' said harry . \\n the trunk was broad enough for the boy to hide behind side-on ; and the tree reached up many metres towards the canopy . \\n will braced himself against the trunk and heaved . \\n harry watched scornfully . \\n then , as the tree moved under pressure from his brother , he watched astonished as it gave and fell , splashing into the ezel . \\n `` your turn , '' said will barely out of breath . \\n a confused harry selected a tree a few metres away . \\n there must be some trick , he thought . \\n or this particular type of tree is unusually weak . \\n he made sure that his tree was of the same species . \\n then he laid his full weight against the trunk . \\n after a full minute of straining and sweating , he gave up . \\n the tree had not budged . \\n will was laughing . \\n `` i told you you were ill , '' he said . \\n `` what 's the trick ? '' \\n said harry when he realised his brother had been winding him up . \\n will tried to maintain his look of innocence but gave up when harry became insistent . \\n `` okay , okay , '' he conceded . \\n `` look at the ground around my tree . '' \\n `` mushrooms ? '' \\n said harry . \\n `` mushrooms , toadstools , whatever , '' said will . \\n `` but you 're right : they 're the key . '' \\n harry frowned as he picked one . \\n to him it looked like a tiny umbrella that had been inverted in a high wind . \\n an idea occurred to him . \\n `` you did n't eat it did you ? '' \\n he had heard of magic mushrooms , though he had little idea about what magic they possessed . \\n will grinned at the idea and shook his head . \\n `` no . \\n it 's the effect they have on the tree , rather than on me . '' \\n `` how ? '' \\n `` look at the base of the trunk . '' \\n he squatted beside the tree ; though its top boughs were in the river , it had yet to be carried away by the current . \\n he showed his brother the ring of fungus around the tree and poked a finger into the now-soft wood of the trunk . \\n `` is it rot ? '' \\n asked harry . \\n `` spot on , '' said will . \\n `` the fungus -- it 's called honey fungus , by the way -- is a parasite . \\n it destroys the tree by rotting the wood . '' \\n `` how do you know ? '' \\n `` i took some time to research what we are supposed to be looking for . '' \\n harry paused . \\n `` what ? '' \\n he asked . \\n `` is this the professor 's fungus ? \\n have we found it ? '' \\n `` no . \\n this is honey fungus ; very common . \\n kills ten per cent of the trees , they reckon . \\n the stuff the professor wants -- he calls it per ram -- is different . \\n this stuff is all over the place . '' \\n `` so much for a thriving ecosystem . '' \\n `` what do you mean ? '' \\n `` all that does is kill . '' \\n harry threw his specimen to the forest floor . \\n `` oh , i see what you mean . \\n but that 's not the way to look at it . \\n it 's all part of the cycle of life and death . \\n the tree dies -- yeah . \\n but other organisms benefit from that death -- all the mulch that comes from this -- '' he tapped the rotten stump `` -- goes back into the system . '' \\n will had a sudden urge to see more of the jungle . \\n `` hey , what do say we wrap it up here ? \\n we 've got all the data we need . \\n and we 've seen nearly all we need to see . '' \\n harry nodded and they picked their way back through the fence and headed for their quarters . \\n he had enjoyed the idea of working on something important with his father and , while he did not pretend to understand all that they had looked at , he knew he was learning about important matters . \\n like his brother , he felt unsettled by the general manager 's dramatic change in attitude . \\n the mine had become as unwelcoming as bolt had , himself . \\n `` there 's something weird about that guy 's mind-set , '' he said . \\n `` could n't do enough while the old man was here . \\n the instant he 's gone , we 're treated like lepers . \\n random . \\n i 'm with you . \\n let 's get going . \\n i like the idea of a boat trip . '' \\n clarridge reappeared . \\n he must have seen them as they walked . \\n he approached them , smiling thinly . \\n just before he got within earshot , harry added : `` what do you mean , ` nearly all ' ? '' \\n will winked and put a furtive finger to his lips for half a second . \\n back at the accommodation block , clarridge gave the brothers time to pack their gear . \\n his manner suggested that he would be happy to see them leave . \\n before they vacated , will tapped out a message on the laptop to send to his father , explaining the reasons for their swift departure . \\n he hit the send button knowing , for the last time before they got to parbo , that the message would certainly be transmitted , thanks to the mine 's overhead aerial . \\n harry sensed , as they bundled their few bits and pieces into holdalls , that his brother was thinking of something other than the boat and the river . \\n `` what 's the plan ? '' \\n he asked . \\n `` down river to parbo , '' will said casually . \\n harry was not convinced . \\n `` before we go , '' he prompted . \\n will looked up and smiled sheepishly . \\n `` how do you know ? '' \\n he asked . \\n harry just grunted . \\n he 'd been will 's brother for long enough to know when will was plotting . \\n `` come on . \\n tell me . '' \\n `` i 've just got a suspicion about bolt . \\n it may be absolutely nothing , but the old man said check things out . \\n the only thing we have n't seen on this site is the inside of bolt 's offices . \\n you know , the area beneath the control tower . \\n i want to take a look round . '' \\n while he continued to stuff clothes into his bag , harry waited for his brother to continue . \\n `` if you go with clarridge to the river , i 'll get in and out before you return . \\n tell him i needed the bog : jungle tummy , or something . \\n okay ? '' \\n harry agreed , reluctantly . \\n he did n't like the idea of either of them incurring the wrath of bolt . \\n `` you got to be quick , though . '' \\n chapter sixteen they finished the packing and waited for the lawyer to return . \\n five minutes later , will eased open the window of the lavatory where he had sat quietly and waited while his brother had persuaded clarridge to carry two bags for him to the river . \\n will dropped silently on to the baked earth behind the accommodation block and , at a crouch , ran to the corner which overlooked the control tower . \\n he had a makeshift plan and , when he had confirmed that the door set discreetly into the concrete was indeed firmly locked , he edged round to the rear of the building . \\n because it was designed to oversee the mining operation , the wall that backed on to the faceless jungle was windowless . \\n in fact , had there been windows the view would have been of little interest . \\n as mining had progressed , nearly every spare flat piece of ground had been occupied by spoil piles . \\n the side of one of these was all that would have been seen from inside the building . \\n that was fortunate for will . \\n he had formulated his plan during the night when he had decided to persuade his father to let him and harry go on alone . \\n he had decided he would check the offices and had assumed he would not be welcomed in with open arms . \\n on the laptop he had used google earth to focus on the mine once more . \\n in the middle of the flat roof of the control building was a square , slightly darker that its surroundings . \\n he guessed what it must be . \\n using the conveniently placed spoil pile , will was able to get a hold on the edge of the roof and haul himself up . \\n the back wall of the control tower now shielded him from any sharp eyes within the mining complex . \\n there , in the middle of the roof , was the skylight . \\n it stood open a few centimetres . \\n half a minute later , will stood on the floor beneath the skylight , surrounded by fruit boxes , barrels and various pieces of machinery . \\n he strained his ears ; there was no sound . \\n the door of the storeroom opened on to a long narrow passageway , lit by a single naked bulb . \\n there was another door straight across the way and one down to the right . \\n the door to the outside , that will had tried earlier , stood solidly staring blankly at him from the far end . \\n that was it . \\n cautiously , will edged down towards the exit . \\n he reached the next door and paused to listen . \\n silence . \\n he eased the handle down and entered what seemed to be the general manager 's living quarters . \\n a single bed stood in one corner ; there were a table and two chairs ; a few personal possessions strewn around the place . \\n a further door , standing ajar , revealed a bathroom . \\n very quickly , will took everything in . \\n all seemed to be in order . \\n he turned to go , closed the door and turned to the one on the other side of the corridor . \\n it was locked . \\n somewhat deflated at this turn of events , will , whose adrenaline levels had risen owing to the clandestine nature of the investigation , slipped quietly back into the storeroom and heaved himself up on to one of the piles of boxes . \\n a slight flush of guilt , of shame , came over will . \\n what , after all , did he think bolt was up to ? \\n he had not a shred of evidence that the man was doing anything wrong . \\n bolt appeared to be running the mining operation with a great degree of competence . \\n he might have become somewhat unpleasant after alan greene 's unscheduled departure but , after all , he did not have baby-sitting written into his contract . \\n and here was will snooping around the man 's private rooms based on the flimsiest of suspicions . \\n forget it , he told himself ; just enjoy the river trip . \\n he was reaching up to the skylight when the crate beneath his right foot gave with a sharp splintering noise . \\n he swayed precariously before regaining his balance and steadying his nerves . \\n he glanced down at the packing . \\n he 'd put his foot in it , all right . \\n a gaping hole stared back at him . \\n he was grateful that he had not dislodged the box . \\n anyone glancing into the storeroom would notice nothing unusual . \\n as he turned his attention back to getting out , a glint of something from inside the box caught his eye . \\n he squatted quickly and pulled back the sharp wooden splinters around the hole . \\n he put in his hand and withdrew a glass bottle -- quite a substantial one . \\n it was about twenty-five centimetres tall , but quite wide . \\n will could only get a hand half round it . \\n he lifted it towards the light in the roof . \\n the label had on it a diamond shape with a stylised skull and cross bones and the word `` toxic '' . \\n two other words suddenly caught will 's attention . \\n he nearly fumbled the bottle as he read : potassium cyanide . \\n he dropped to the floor and examined the stack of crates . \\n there were scores of them . \\n each crate contained six two-litre bottles . \\n what did bolt want with -- will estimated quickly -- several hundred litres of one of the most deadly poisons known to humanity ? \\n and why were they in cases marked `` green leaf canned peaches -- this side up '' ? \\n of course , there could be a rational explanation . \\n but suddenly , will knew he had to get into the locked room . \\n his father 's words came back to him : finish the job ... be thorough . \\n he glanced at his watch . \\n he 'd been inside for just over five minutes . \\n harry would not be able to keep clarridge busy for much longer . \\n quickly he slipped out of the storeroom and across the corridor . \\n the door refused to budge . \\n will trotted down to bolt 's quarters again . \\n this time he paced the room , scrutinising surfaces . \\n he dipped his hand into the pockets of a leather jacket which hung from the door : nothing . \\n magazines and papers on the desk appeared to have been dropped in no particular order . \\n even so will was careful not to disturb them too much as he looked for clues or a key . \\n he had seen the small bedside cabinet the first time he had entered the room ; he 'd noticed the book left on it -- a fat novel by someone called wilbur smith with a picture of lions on the cover . \\n but he had n't registered the drawer in the front of the cabinet . \\n he stepped across the room and slid it open . \\n it contained nothing . \\n disappointment descended on will . \\n he would have to leave the locked room with its secrets intact . \\n on impulse -- and only because he had once read an article in a newspaper written by an ex-spy -- he pulled the drawer right out of the cabinet . \\n it was very slight and cheaply made -- glue instead of joinery -- but , as he turned it over , he saw , to his astonishment , a large key taped to its underside . \\n he ran the short distance along the corridor , slipped the key into the lock and grinned as it turned smoothly . \\n he stepped inside . \\n the room was dark . \\n he could make out vague shapes , partially lit by borrowed light from the bulb in the passage . \\n instinctively , his reaching hand found the wall switch and light bathed the room . \\n the first thing he saw was to his left . \\n a table with a green cloth hanging from it had a battle scene arranged on it . \\n miniature soldiers stood on the rucked-up surface facing each other , guns in hand . \\n the detritus of nineteenth century warfare was distributed on the battlefield between the ranks of the opposing sides . \\n behind the charging soldiers -- who stood , mid-step , frozen in time until the imagination which had placed them returned -- batteries of scale model canon pointed at each other . \\n it was a scene familiar to will . \\n he had spent many hours reconstructing battles when he had been younger . \\n however , he had favoured more modern representations of warfare -- plastic figures of british commandos doing battle against the afrika corps in the deserts of tunisia ; and harry 's preference , for fantasy wars between intergalactic orks , slayers and imperial space marines , had only recently waned . \\n this appeared to be a scene from the napoleonic wars . \\n will thought he could distinguish between the french army and the british and prussian forces ranged against them . \\n some of the mounted soldiers bore standards and those in mid-charge brandished curved sabres . \\n the foot soldiers were formed into fighting squares , muskets pointing to the action . \\n all were painstakingly painted . \\n the blue tunics of the french , clashed with the scarlet of the british . \\n the prussians , observing the current action from a remote vantage point at the far end of the table , were in various shades of grey . \\n much effort had been expended adding detail : the gold braid and white belts had been applied deftly . \\n he walked to the table and thoughtfully lifted one of the canon : heavy lead . \\n he slipped the model into his pocket . \\n he turned his attention to the rest of the room , an office of sorts . \\n a large desk stood against a wall , a leather upholstered swivel-chair next to it . \\n a computer , in sleep mode , waited patiently next to a telephone and a small printer . \\n a row of files occupied a shelf above the desk and , to the right , on the wall , was a large-scale map . \\n it was a map of the immediate area . \\n in fact , will realised , as he recognised the very building in which he stood , it was a hybrid map : a satellite photograph with geographical features superimposed on it . \\n the apetina mine was circled in red marker pen , not that it really needed highlighting -- the dirty rent in the verdant jungle stood out starkly next to the river . \\n the rest of the wall map was stubbornly green except where the ezel river and its tributaries meandered across the land . \\n not quite the rest , will noted . \\n there was another area which had been doctored , this time , much more discreetly : a small dot , again in red marker , and almost invisible amongst the busy margin between river and land . \\n will estimated it to be thirty kilometres away from the mine , straight through the jungle to the north east ; a lot further via the river system but quicker as the going would be easier . \\n he stood close to the map , looking up at the spot . \\n nothing distinguished the area around it from the rest of the jungle . \\n but it must have some significance . \\n he quickly whipped the topmost leaf from a post-it pad on bolt 's desk and , taking up a pencil , drew a crude map of the waterways which twisted and turned between the apetina mine and whatever was marked by the red spot . \\n glancing at the edges of the wall map , he noted the grid bearings and jotted them down . \\n information which might be useful later , he thought . \\n he turned his attention to a filing cabinet which stood , isolated , against another wall . \\n it was not locked . \\n whoever conducted affairs from inside this room -- bolt , presumably -- trusted that no one would ever find the key to the door . \\n the top drawer contained several boxes of ammunition , the shiny bullets standing to attention like the toy soldiers in their squares . \\n will slid it shut with a clang . \\n the one below was divided into various sections . \\n there appeared to be records of deliveries to and from the mine , employee records , payroll -- all the most boring administrative paperwork which someone is always condemned to deal with . \\n the bottom drawer , however , was locked . \\n will pulled out the middle drawer again , felt underneath and , not quite to his surprise , found a key . \\n it fitted the lock . \\n as he gingerly slid the drawer out , will noticed the red dot on its top left hand corner . \\n there were several files hanging in the drawer . \\n will quickly riffled through them . \\n boring letters , bills -- stuff he had no real idea about . \\n one of the suspended files had the red dot . \\n he homed in on it . \\n the documents in it were as dull as the rest . \\n he lifted two out at random . \\n the first was a document handwritten in a language he did n't recognise . \\n he shoved it back . \\n the second , a red dot in the top right corner , looked like another bill . \\n will was just about the stuff it back into the drawer and leave when , first , he read the words `` green leaf peaches '' next to a date and price , and secondly , he heard the front door open . \\n the scrape of the key in the lock was unmistakable ; the screech of the hinges confirmed to will that he was no longer alone . \\n voices reached him . \\n one of them he recognised as that of the general manager . \\n `` i know . \\n we can do without this interference . \\n but come on , greene 's gone . \\n we have a date with a fat american in the jungle . '' \\n will reached feverishly for the key . \\n he shoved the drawer shut and locked it , tugging at the one above it in the process . \\n whatever sticky had held the key in place before will had found it was still there : he slapped the key on to the underside of the drawer , where it stuck . \\n he rammed the drawer shut , silently cursing as metal clanged against metal . \\n he stood and cast around for an escape route . \\n there was none . \\n no window , no skylight , no convenient closet . \\n bolt continued to talk as he led his companion down the corridor : `` this morning is for sport , my friend . \\n the best quarry is human quarry . \\n there is no doubt in his mind that the slightest mistake will result in the loss of his life . \\n not so in the animal realm . \\n animals have instinct -- the instinct to survive , to keep on running . \\n human beings understand the mechanism by which their death will be brought to them . \\n it is an exquisite refinement of the hunt . \\n trust me : you will enjoy . '' \\n the man with bolt laughed nervously . \\n they were directly outside the door which stood ajar . \\n `` gott , '' bolt spat . \\n `` i will forget my own head one day . \\n i must have had a skin full last night , no ? '' \\n he laughed and pushed open the door . \\n will saw them as they entered the room . \\n each of them held a gun -- steel barrels , polished wooden stocks , telescopic sights . \\n guns for hunting : rifles . \\n the new man wore clothes similar to those worn by bolt -- khaki shorts and short-sleeved shirt , knee-length socks and tough boots which rose to protect the ankles . \\n he also wore a faded yellow neckerchief and a slouch hat . \\n from beneath the table with the toy soldiers , will peered between the curtains of green baize which concealed him . \\n he watched the other man walk over to the map on the wall and tap it with the barrel of his rifle . \\n when he spoke , will recognised his accent : australian . \\n `` when do we get back to the real business ? \\n where the real money is . \\n i ca n't stand this place . \\n what say we get a few of the other lads in on the scheme ; '' -- again , he tapped the wall map with his rifle -- `` man , we 'd clear up in a few days . '' \\n `` patience , my friend . \\n the less people who know about our little investment the better . \\n and this place , as you call it , is crucial to our operation up country . \\n as long as the mine runs smooth , we 'll be left alone . \\n i think i convinced greene . \\n if he buys , he 'll keep me on to run it . \\n shame about the landslip but it got him on his way . \\n `` now , i always have time for a little pleasure before business , '' bolt changed the subject . \\n `` let 's go hunt . \\n we 've got time to kill while the greenehorns disappear down river . '' \\n he laughed . \\n `` that knock on the head must have banged out all the sense of the man . \\n imagine leaving children in the jungle . '' \\n `` let 's get on with it , mate . \\n give us some shells ; let 's get out there and then we can get down river to our little investment -- see how the workers are getting on . '' \\n `` here , '' bolt said , pulling out the top drawer of the filing cabinet . \\n he lobbed a box of rounds to the other man who caught it deftly . \\n he began to transfer the shells into the pockets of his shorts . \\n one dropped to the floor and rolled slowly towards the table . \\n the aussie hissed a quiet oath and knelt to retrieve it . \\n his face came level with will 's . \\n the man was unshaven and close enough for will to smell his sweat . \\n there was a badge clipped to the front of his shirt with the man 's name on it : axel hoover . \\n the bullet rolled under the edge of the draped baize . \\n will looked at it in horror . \\n a gnarled hand reached under the green curtain and groped about on the floor . \\n will had no choice : he picked the bullet up by its tip and placed it just in front of the searching fingers . \\n `` come ` ere , you little bugger ! '' \\n the aussie exclaimed as he grasped the wayward shell . \\n he stood . \\n will sighed silently . \\n `` y ' ready , dolph ? '' \\n the men left the room . \\n will 's moment of relief was short-lived . \\n he realised with a jolt that bolt would want to lock the door . \\n assuming he had been a little worse for wear the previous evening , he would naturally go to get the key from his room . \\n when he found it missing , his suspicions would be aroused . \\n will did not want that to happen . \\n he had only one chance . \\n he moved as quietly and quickly as he could to the doorway . \\n as he glanced into the corridor , he saw bolt turn into his bedroom , as the other man walked past towards the outside door , preoccupied as he fed bullets into his rifle clip . \\n will took his chance and silently slipped across the passage and into the storeroom . \\n he pushed the door to behind him , not daring to shut it properly for fear of the snap of the latch attracting attention . \\n he told himself to slow down , not to leap for the pile of crates . \\n splintering wood and smashing glass were sure to give him away . \\n he regulated his breathing and placed a foot on the lowest crate . \\n bolt 's voice carried from the room down the corridor . \\n `` i have no idea what i have done with the blasted key . '' \\n there was no suspicion in the voice ; it was almost as though bolt were used to losing things , had mislaid the key before . \\n `` come on , dolph , '' the australian called . \\n `` pull your finger out . \\n we 've got that yank to fillet and things to do later . '' \\n there were indistinct words exchanged , some swearing from both men , then the outside door clanged shut . \\n the key turned in the lock . \\n will , half way up a stack of crates of deadly poison , let out another sigh of relief . \\n as he made his way cautiously across the roof and back to the open window of the lavatory , will considered what he had seen . \\n bolt liked to keep the office secure . \\n the absurd thought crossed will 's mind that the general manager was embarrassed by his hobby . \\n but that could not be it . \\n why bring your hobby into the jungle only to hide it away ? \\n there was something else about the room that had led bolt to avoid taking them there while they were shown the rest of the mine . \\n the only thing that seemed suspicious was the red mark on the wall map . \\n but there were no clues as to what might be there . \\n there was a footfall outside and harry 's voice broke in on his thoughts . \\n `` have n't you finished ? \\n we 're all loaded . \\n come on , i 'll see you at the river . '' \\n will was about to open the door , when he recalled the paper he had lifted from the filing cabinet . \\n as bolt and the aussie had entered , in his panic , will had stashed it in on top of the canon . \\n the weight of the toy canon had reminded him . \\n he smoothed it out and gave it a more thorough look . \\n there was a red dot on it in the top right hand corner . \\n it seemed to be a delivery note or a supply manifest . \\n the details referred to green leaf peaches . \\n a large number of crates had been delivered to the apetina mine only three days earlier . \\n the cost -- eighteen thousand dollars , us -- seemed a trifle excessive for a fruit delivery . \\n but then the fruit crates will had used as a ladder did not contain peaches . \\n he could well believe a large quantity of potassium cyanide in solution might cost a lot more . \\n a rubber stamp had been used to apply `` paid '' in large letters in red ink across the paper . \\n although the apetina mine had no use for potassium cyanide , potassium cyanide had arrived in large quantities and zmi had paid for it . \\n it seemed likely that the only two people who knew about this deceptive arrangement were will greene and adolphus bolt . \\n will stepped from the cubicle and walked down to the river , deep in thought . \\n chapter seventeen clarridge saw them off . \\n there was no sign of bolt . \\n the lawyer wished them well and told them he hoped to see them again if their report stood up to the scrutiny of their father . \\n will stepped nimbly into the raptor as harry opened the throttle and gave the wheel an experimental turn . \\n the boat -- beautifully crafted -- responded immediately and , with no more fuss , they swept out into the swollen waters of the ezel . \\n will 's original worry about letting harry drive was immediately dispelled as his younger brother deftly wove his way around three small boats moored at the jetty . \\n clarridge turned to resume his work , grateful that the two greene boys were off his hands . \\n a large man in blue zmi overalls and a hardhat , carrying a tote bag bumped into the lawyer . \\n the two men exchanged muttered apologies . \\n clarridge walked off the jetty and towards the control tower . \\n he thought no more about the encounter . \\n mw , on the other hand , held his breath , desperate not to be challenged at this point . \\n he had picked the boat which he was going to steal and he needed to go now if he were to keep the boys within his reach . \\n he had nothing to fear : clarridge 's mind was preoccupied by legal details relating to mining and how they affected the operation . \\n he had no time for the mine workers ; he 'd already forgotten the boys . \\n when mw slipped confidently into one of the boats , none of the workers thought anything of it . \\n a couple of them even returned his friendly wave . \\n everybody was busy . \\n no one suspected a boat thief in the middle of the jungle . \\n for the first few kilometres , harry got the feel of the raptor , zigzagging across the broad waterway . \\n will busied himself making sure they had everything they should have . \\n all the provisions supplied by mac -- fresh water , dehydrated meals , high-energy bars -- were stowed securely , together with some basic camping equipment . \\n he spent some time studying the satellite photos that he had downloaded on to the laptop . \\n already highlighted on the map was the apetina mine and , when will tapped in a code , the coordinates that professor ramsundar had given them , a pair of lines , one horizontal , one vertical , appeared on the screen . \\n they moved across the map and stopped . \\n where they crossed , was the exact location of the professor 's find , just over a year ago . \\n will reached into his pocket and pulled out the canon he had taken from bolt 's office . \\n around it was still wrapped the delivery docket for the peaches ; and , stuck to that , was the post-it note on which will had recorded the coordinates of the red dot on bolt 's wall chart . \\n he tapped the coordinates in . \\n the suspicion he had been harbouring since he had made a note of the position was confirmed . \\n the red dot -lrb- whatever it was -rrb- and the professor 's location were virtually identical . \\n if they were to go to one , they may as well go to both . \\n will made up his mind there and then , he was going to see what bolt and his associates were hiding . \\n what had the australian said ? \\n `` real money , real business '' ? \\n will was resolute : he needed to see what bolt was up to . \\n in the meantime , he and his brother were going to enjoy the unspoilt beauty of the rainforest . \\n a few hundred metres south of the boys ' position , another small craft followed in their wake . \\n mw , at the wheel , was careful not to get anywhere near the raptor . \\n he hung back as harry rounded bends , then moved forward to allow him to check that they were still going downstream . \\n keeping tabs on them was reasonably straightforward and , as long as he was careful , there was little likelihood of being spotted . \\n brief busts of speed brought him to the apex of a bend in the river or to an island , from where he could peer cautiously at the greenes ' progress . \\n he had no need to get any closer until he was sure they had found the precious fungus . \\n for much of the morning mw shadowed the greenes . \\n there was no alternative route for them to take until midday when , watching from a safe distance , mw saw the boys ' raptor turn to the east -lrb- effectively a right turn off the main waterway -rrb- into a tributary . \\n he considered the situation , studying the map he had lifted in the stuyvesant hotel . \\n the greenes were in search of the fungus he had heard them talk about . \\n they would need to return to parbo . \\n the meant they would have to retrace their steps down the tributary and join the ezel once more . \\n mw concluded that there was no reason for him to follow them . \\n it made much more sense to wait for their return . \\n why should he endure the misery of more jungle than he had to ? \\n why take any more risks ? \\n casting his gaze across the wide stretch of the ezel , he decided to settle down and let the boys bring the fungus to him . \\n *** the going was slower as the screw of the mercury laboured to push the raptor against the flow of the river . \\n time seemed to slow down and the boys were able to take in their surroundings with few distractions . \\n the water was still a muddy brown colour but fish would break the surface frequently ; caimans dozed on the banks , occasionally slithering into the shallows , with a splash , in search of a meal . \\n in and around the trees which overhung the river there was a lot of activity . \\n heavy winged vultures drifted lazily , scruffily , above the canopy , red and yellow necks craning for prey , while monkeys screeched angrily at them and leapt from bough to bough . \\n smaller , brightly coloured birds stationed themselves in the lower branches , pecking at bark , looking for grubs . \\n will had harry slow and stop the raptor so he could photograph the wildlife . \\n it was remarkable how little notice the creatures took of the human intrusion on their territory . \\n will speculated that animals with no real contact with humans had no reason to fear them . \\n it reminded him of the sad end that had met the dodo . \\n though he 'd seen a stuffed specimen at the museum in bristol , he secretly harboured the thought that no real animal could look like that . \\n the fat waddling bird with the ludicrous beak had never encountered humans , had existed in happy isolation on the island of mauritius , until sailors landed in the seventeenth century . \\n the unsuspecting dodos had stood innocently still as the sailors had , for sport and for food , pointed their muskets and flintlocks at them and blasted them to extinction in the space a few short years . \\n there were precious few regions of the world left in pristine condition , untroubled by man 's intrusion , will reminded himself . \\n he was profoundly grateful for this opportunity to experience one of them . \\n the day drew on and will busied himself putting his photos on to the laptop and then on to his memory stick . \\n he consulted the coordinates he had been given by professor ramsundar and realised they were now not far from their destination . \\n as he had done unsuccessfully on several occasions already during the day , he tried the satellite phone . \\n it was dead . \\n he was grateful that he had managed to get a message off from the mine before they 'd left . \\n round the next long bend in the river , the flow was split . \\n what appeared to be another tributary entered the main stream from the right . \\n but the boys ' way was interrupted by a series of rapids , marked by boulders and white water . \\n they were forced to slow and pick their way through the debris-strewn river , gunning the motor to take them up chutes of fast-flowing brown water and seeking a way around the rocks . \\n the head of the rapids was about a kilometre up steam and it was past mid-afternoon before the raptor was clear of the obstruction and once more picked up speed . \\n to the right , again , they saw a another branch of the river , this time taking the flow away from the main stream and they realised that this fork was the beginning of the one they had seen below the rapids . \\n at some stage in the distant past , the river had sought out two routes downhill : one had tumbled over the broken riverbed , grinding out the rough course that will and harry has just travelled up ; the other had serenely run down another way , creating a great island between the streams . \\n another sweeping bend , and now will was consulting the gps panel in the console of the raptor . \\n another kilometre or two , he estimated . \\n the boat hit something with a dull thud . \\n harry had been cautiously easing the raptor along at low speed , waiting for his brother to indicate they had reached the correct position . \\n it was always necessary to keep one eye on the water ahead in order to take evasive action when , occasionally , a semi-submerged log floated by . \\n there was no real danger as long as the boat was kept at a reasonable speed ; its hull had been designed to cope with light impacts . \\n the thud was a surprise to harry who had seen nothing ahead of them . \\n he peered into the river and caught sight of a long , off-white log . \\n it was certainly tree-like . \\n then he realised , as he caught sight of a hind leg and an armoured tail , he was looking at a dead caiman , the south american crocodile . \\n the bump would have done no damage to the boat , but both boys peered anxiously ahead , nevertheless . \\n there was something else in the water . \\n a flash of silver and the boat passed a large fish , belly up . \\n two more floated by . \\n another caiman hit the hull and , suddenly , the river around the boat was full of death . \\n fish floated by , lifeless . \\n in the space of a few minutes , a dozen caiman -- some young , some mature , measuring well over two metres -- all dead , hundreds of fish , and the corpses of numerous monkeys and birds , filled the water in a macabre procession of the jungle 's fauna . \\n harry killed the motor . \\n silence . \\n not a sound from the jungle . \\n it was a strange and disconcerting feeling . \\n in the middle of this verdant , vibrant forest , a place where life in almost infinite diversity thrived , nothing seemed to live . \\n the quiet was unnatural ; the still that had descended on the river , alien . \\n the sense of revulsion they felt quickly led them to move on upstream . \\n will and harry could not make out what was the cause of the carnage and were greatly relieved when they passed through the dead zone . \\n there was no obvious explanation for the grisly scene they 'd witnessed and they felt a mood of dread lift as the jungle came to life once more . \\n fifteen minutes later , they eased the boat on to a shingle beach . \\n the gps indicated they were at the location the professor had given them . \\n practicalities came first . \\n it was important that the boat was well secured , and that they ate well before they began to check out the area . \\n a sense of responsibility came over will as the brothers set foot on the river bank . \\n if he were to put his own plan into operation -- the one he had so far failed to tell harry about -- he had a responsibility to see that his brother was at least prepared for the consequences if will were to fail . \\n there was no doubt in his mind that adolphus bolt hid some secret in the jungle , no more than a few kilometres away . \\n will meant to find out what that secret was . \\n he was unwilling to place his brother in peril and laid out his plan as they dug into rehydrated rations -- shepherd 's pie followed by toffee sponge and custard -lrb- both more like thick soup than the real thing ; and eaten from the bags they were supplied in -rrb- . \\n `` of course , we 'd cover more ground more rapidly if we split up . '' \\n will pointed his spoon at the interior . \\n `` you go through there , up the hill . \\n try to find a sample . \\n take this jar and just cram a load of fungus into it . '' \\n will passed his brother the small water bottle he 'd just emptied . \\n harry nodded his agreement though he was not optimistic . \\n `` how are we supposed to find one mushroom in the jungle ? \\n and if we find one , how do we know it 's the right one ? '' \\n `` give it a sniff , '' will advised . \\n `` the prof said it was a bit pongy . \\n and here , '' he reached over to pass harry a slip of paper , `` is his photo of the thing . '' \\n `` which way are you going ? '' \\n harry asked as he stared at the picture . \\n he tried so hard to sound nonchalant . \\n and almost succeeded . \\n but will detected the trace of worry in the question . \\n he felt nothing but a sense of affection for his younger brother . \\n the kid had been taken so far from the surroundings he was used to that it was not surprising that he was feeling a little unsure of himself . \\n how many fourteen-year-old english schoolboys are suddenly thrust into the jungle with instructions to locate a cure for countless thousands of sufferers around the world ? \\n `` i 'll just be looking down there . '' \\n he pointed back down the river , trying to sound as casual as he could . \\n `` we 'll come back here , hopefully before dark , and get some kip . \\n if we 're lucky , we 'll have what we need and be away in the morning . \\n it 's only a day or two 's travel to brokopondo , with the flow of the river . \\n couple of nights , we 'll be back in the hotel . '' \\n harry smiled a smile that was more confident than he felt and agreed . \\n will , of course , had more than one goal . \\n he set off determined to find out bolt 's secret . \\n he must report to his father anything which had a bearing on the operation at apetina . \\n harry struck out in the other direction fiercely determined not to show his apprehension . \\n within two minutes , the jungle had swallowed each of the brothers separately . \\n chapter eighteen at least , harry thought to himself , there was no need to hack a way through . \\n he had seen many old movies where safari-suited hunters struggled to make progress through thick bamboo forests , slashing manfully with lethal-looking machetes . \\n the surinamese jungle was more forgiving . \\n as he moved away from the river , the ground rose gently . \\n there seemed to be a boundary between the thick overhang which flourished lushly alongside the water and the ancient forest itself , where the vegetation was slightly less immense . \\n the trees , though reaching up toward the same height as the real canopy , were thin and straight ; the bushes , while four times as tall as harry , seemed to have room to spread out ; and the undergrowth was thin . \\n the ground began to rise more steeply and harry found himself in a world of green twilight . \\n he looked up and was struck by the sheer stature of the trees . \\n some were thin as telegraph poles ; some had massive girths -- giants supporting their own ecosystems . \\n all of them towered away to join the canopy . \\n harsh equatorial sunlight was filtered by the leaves into a spectral glow . \\n the shafts of light which managed to get through the canopy were like gleaming lances which pierced the forest floor . \\n the reason why the forest grew in this particular way was , harry remembered , from some long-past geography lesson , that the trees all competed for the nourishing attention of the sun , thrusting their branches higher and higher . \\n as a result , it was far easier to move around on the ground : not enough sunlight got through to encourage really wild growth around the bases of the trees . \\n harry steadily climbed the hill casting around for any likely spot for the fungus he 'd come so far to find . \\n at the back of his mind it seemed improbable that , based on a set of coordinates written down in england , he might expect to walk straight up to the correct stand of mushrooms having just stepped from the boat . \\n and so it turned out . \\n not only was there no sign of fungus , there was no sign of any habitat that might encourage its growth . \\n the rainforest was vibrantly alive ; there was no decaying wood for the professor 's fungus to develop . \\n after a half hour of aimless searching , harry 's mind began to wander off in different directions . \\n one of the things he had imagined while lying awake thinking of this trip , was the chance to encounter some of the more exotic creatures of the rainforest . \\n he had seen caimans , some unremarkable fish , tree-dwelling monkeys and scores of species of bird . \\n but what he really wanted to see were the stars of the jungle -- the great snakes , the piranha and the jaguar , latin america 's big cat . \\n deep down , he realised that the chances of seeing any of those creatures were slim . \\n -lrb- and some distant , sensible part of his mind told him it would perhaps be better not to meet any of them . -rrb- \\n these were animals that prowled and slithered and swam in this habitat with two main priorities : to avoid unnecessary danger and to secure enough to eat . \\n nowhere in that scheme did a fourteen-year-old boy from england fit in . \\n unless , mused harry , he was stupid enough to topple into the ezel when a shoal of piranha was passing . \\n despite these thoughts , the prospect of seeing something more interesting than mushrooms , drove him up the slope at a crouch and on to a plateau where the jungle stood awaiting him . \\n he slowed to a halt and took the time to look carefully at his surroundings . \\n he stopped looking into the distance -lrb- as far as that was possible in the jungle -rrb- and began to take a close interest in the life right next to him . \\n he paused to pull a twig from his basketball boot , leaning against a tree to steady himself . \\n the slim branch next to his hand moved cautiously away from him ! \\n he stared in surprise and then realised the branch was in fact a stick insect of some sort . \\n even when it was moving -- slowly , robotically -- he had to tell himself it was not part of the tree . \\n then he noticed the line of ants which extended each way along the branch and into the forest . \\n it was a perfectly formed and well-drilled display of complete cooperation . \\n one file marched to the left , the other , each member carrying a sheet of leaf more than twice its size , to the right . \\n along the ranks a sergeant or two scurried to keep the lines moving . \\n harry would never know what they were doing , never see their nest ; it was enough , though , to stand and watch the marvel as it happened in front of him . \\n there was something quite different about finding these things for yourself rather than seeing them on the television . \\n this was an infinitely complex organisation while , at the same time , an infinitely small part of the planet earth 's interconnected bionetworks . \\n harry was impressed . \\n he spent an hour examining the minute inhabitants of one of the world 's great ecosystems , reflecting that , somehow , all the earth 's activities fitted together and worked together in harmony to create the environment that all species on the planet -lrb- including mankind -rrb- relied on totally for their survival . \\n there was no bail out , no clause that stated when the earth was finished mankind had the option to go to another planet and carry on where it had left off . \\n this was the only option . \\n harry found himself making comparison with the human body . \\n he was pleased with the metaphor . \\n the human body needed all its parts to function effectively and healthily . \\n it was possible for humans survive and even thrive if bits of the body were damaged -- the loss of a toe , a finger , even a leg or an arm . \\n but when the vital organs are damaged , there is real cause for concern . \\n a damaged heart or polluted lungs leads to malfunctions and the slowing down of the body . \\n if the damage gets too great , the body can no longer function and the human dies . \\n harry had heard the environmentalists referring to the great tropical rainforests as the lungs of the planet , but never before had he felt so strongly that their warnings were of the greatest import . \\n the earth was in danger . \\n something moved in the light undergrowth ; there was a noise -- half grunt , half snort -- a quiet noise ; for some reason , it sounded like a noise of fear . \\n harry dropped to his haunches and peered intently at the jungle for the source of the noise . \\n it came again . \\n was there a little panicky whine in there , this time ? \\n in the dappled half-light of the clearing beneath the canopy , yellows and browns danced across the leaves . \\n one second they had no discernible shape , the next , harry was looking at a small creature which was clearly scared , as it stepped into the space in front of him . \\n it was a bizarre specimen . \\n an infant , it stood no more than thirty centimetres high and tottered on legs , black with white spots . \\n its body carried white stripes which ran horizontally through its short black fur . \\n its face and ears were almost bald but , where the hair grew , there were a few of the white spots . \\n its pink ears stuck up like a cat 's . \\n but the feature that placed it apart from other creatures was its extraordinary extended nose which drooped over its mouth , almost like the beginnings of an elephantine trunk . \\n harry knew exactly what it was . \\n he had seen a baby tapir in the zoo a few years earlier . \\n he recalled some of the details he 'd read at the enclosure . \\n strangely , this little guy , the size of a jack russell dog , was closely related to horses and , stranger still , rhinoceroses . \\n harry , who loved all animals , was immediately taken with the little fellow . \\n he began to make cooing noises and edged forward as the tapir 's nose twitched , trying to get harry 's scent . \\n the baby seemed unconcerned at the human 's presence though , clearly , it was anxious about something . \\n moving as slowly as he could and cooing and talking soft nonsense , the boy approached the baby beast . \\n it pawed the soft loamy ground with hard little hooves , nervous , but unwilling to run . \\n harry stretched out a hand . \\n the tapir stretched out its mini trunk and sniffed the hand extended to it . \\n harry thought it was a strange-looking cross between a pig and a dog -- sweet , nevertheless . \\n when he stroked its back , its fur felt prickly . \\n the baby did not back away ; it seemed to take some comfort from the attention it was receiving . \\n `` are you a little bit lost , matey ? '' \\n harry whispered . \\n `` me , too , '' he added . \\n he tickled the tapir under its chin , which it obviously enjoyed . \\n `` have you lost your mummy ? '' \\n he asked . \\n `` i know how you feel . '' \\n there was a sudden crack behind harry , a snap of wood , a swish through leaves , as something else arrived in the clearing . \\n harry was thinking more of the baby than of himself . \\n rather than startle it by sudden movement , he turned slowly , still stroking it to see who had arrived . \\n ten metres away stood the baby 's mother . \\n the fully grown tapir is a fearsome creature , despite its peculiar appearance . \\n and , though it looks docile enough -- a little sad , even -- when left alone , once it is riled , it bares its yellow teeth in an alarming bray , like a demented pig-horse . \\n the main danger , however , stems from the animal 's great bulk . \\n it stands at over a metre at the shoulder and weighs up to 450 kilograms -- more than six times harry 's weight . \\n this is the tapir 's weapon of choice ; it is a heavy-duty battering ram and will charge anything -- especially if it thinks its calf is in peril . \\n to harry 's advantage was the fact that tapirs have very poor eyesight ; the big mama peered blearily through the clearing 's light from small dark eyes . \\n to his great disadvantage were the tapir 's exceptional senses of smell and hearing , not to mention the fact that harry was between mama and baby . \\n the outraged mother 's nose waved in the air , the short ears turned on top of her head like mini radar dishes , assessing the scene before her . \\n it was clear that mama tapir was about to save her baby . \\n no one could blame her for her actions , least of all harry greene who sat mesmerised as the great black beast began her charge . \\n it takes a thoroughbred race horse eight strides to go beyond the magical forty miles per hour , acceleration outmatched only be the cheetah on the ground . \\n this equine cousin was not that quick but , given her bulk and shorter legs , she covered the ground remarkably quickly . \\n harry had only a second or so to think -- too short a time to come up with a considered plan -- so he did what came instinctively . \\n he had no desire to be hit by the equivalent of the castlemead first team scrum at twenty-five miles per hour , all concentrated into one place . \\n he had no desire , either , to keep the tapir calf from its mother . \\n the whole thing happened too fast for him to register anything other than passing surprise . \\n as the mama tapir reached him , he was already launching himself backwards ; the left shoulder of the battering ram gave him impetus and boosted his trajectory . \\n over the edge of the plateau he went , arms swinging , legs stretching -- where was the purchase ? \\n -- into the void . \\n suddenly , there was nothing . \\n a brief moment of total silence , of no sense of touch and , though his eyes were open , harry registered no sight . \\n the impact , when it came , was cushioned . \\n harry landed on his back and was immediately enveloped in a cloud of dust . \\n his senses returned ; he smelled a damp musty odour and then a sharp unpleasant stink . \\n he had time to place it as he lay , subconsciously checking for broken bones . \\n the smell reminded him of socks after a match , of bad body odour . \\n he heard the flump of his landing , a sound like falling on to a bed from a great height . \\n he felt the dust swirling around him , saw its yellow clouds billow up . \\n instinctively , he looked to where the danger was and , at the top of the steep drop he had fallen over , the face of the mother tapir peered through the undergrowth , her nose twitching . \\n the baby stood between her front legs , nuzzling its mother . \\n harry 's heart thumped . \\n he breathed deeply , despite the stink . \\n slowly , he eased himself up on to his elbow and took stock of his surroundings . \\n the jungle around him was much the same . \\n he lay in the middle of a small , leafy glade , much of it in shadow . \\n around him , like a frozen splash , was scattered the remains of the tree trunk which had saved him from injury . \\n it had been rotten to its core and had acted like a huge airbag , breaking his fall as it exploded , sending the dusty particles of rotten wood into the still air . \\n he rolled and there was a popping noise . \\n something delicate beneath him was being crushed by his weight . \\n there was a redoubling of the stench of bad feet . \\n suddenly , he knew he had found the professor 's fungus . \\n he was , in fact , lying in the middle of a small patch of mushroom-like fungus , those he had not squashed standing like a fantasy forest in miniature . \\n they grew on and around the rotten wood . \\n he stood and dragged the picture from his pocket . \\n it was the one will had been given by the professor ; the one ramsundar had drawn himself . \\n the bluish-grey caps , a couple of centimetres high on white stalks , matched those in the photo . \\n the smell confirmed that his search was over . \\n he glanced up to where the tapirs had been . \\n they were gone . \\n `` thank you , mama t , '' he called softly . \\n it took harry an hour to retrace his footsteps back to the river . \\n in his pocket was the bottle into which he had crammed the few undamaged specimens of fungus he had recovered . \\n the professor should be more than happy with the find . \\n there was no sign of will when harry got to the boat . \\n he settled down for a brew , heating a pan of water over the small stove mac had supplied them with . \\n harry was quite pleased with himself . \\n he looked forward to the praise he was sure to get from his brother . \\n the day was drawing to a close and the light was beginning to fade from the jungle . \\n chapter nineteen will reckoned the spot marked on bolt 's map with the red dot was only a few kilometres downstream . \\n in fact , they must have passed it as they searched for the place where the professor said they 'd find the fungus . \\n after a false start , during which will had tried to cut the bend in the river , and had ploughed into thick jungle , he had found it quite easy to stick to the shingle beach between forest and water . \\n occasionally , he was forced inland to skirt some projecting obstacle but , for the main part , he made good progress . \\n after half an hour , he found a quiet backwater which broke off from the main stream and which formed a small island . \\n it was heavily overhung by jungle greenery and , from any distance , was almost invisible . \\n from his vantage point , he realised that he and harry had cruised past it oblivious to its existence . \\n he crept forward , sure that he was near whatever it was he was seeking . \\n suddenly , he saw a small , but well maintained jetty jutting out from the bank , a shallow-hulled boat moored to it , and he heard the dull cough of a generator . \\n excitement gripped him : there was something here . \\n a hundred metres further on and he had left the main river behind . \\n the clearing he encountered was screened from the main river by the island . \\n in the distance , he saw the backwater curve around the island to where it re-joined the main stream , again , heavily camouflaged by the jungle . \\n it was a perfect location for a secret operation . \\n now all he had to do was find out what sort of operation it was . \\n there was activity on the river bank . \\n will silently cursed himself for not having brought a pair of binoculars . \\n he could not make out what the men on the shore were up to . \\n beyond them , there were a few low-slung huts . \\n they looked like they were built of corrugated iron , hastily put together , never intended for any permanent use . \\n the noise of the generator came from this isolated camp . \\n he had no option : nearer . \\n will cut into the jungle . \\n the going was harder but he soon reached the edge of the clearing . \\n there was no fence to mark the boundary . \\n instead , the trunks of felled trees lay like beached whales around the perimeter . \\n enough ground had been cleared to accommodate the needs of the camp and no more . \\n there were three huts which stood together on the far side . \\n away to the right was an arrangement of canvass sheets which seemed to house washing and toilet facilities . \\n closest to will was a more substantial building -- still corrugated iron -- with a heavily barred door . \\n in front of the three huts , away from the river , stood an open sided structure which had trestle tables set beneath it . \\n beside that , was a large fire smouldering gently , with a collection of blackened pots hanging from iron hooks : the kitchen , will supposed . \\n he worked his way slowly round the camp which , apart from the activity at the river bank , seemed deserted . \\n he noted that one of the three huts at the far side of the clearing had smoke trickling from the iron pipe which stood for a chimney . \\n it took will twenty minutes to sidle round into a position where he could peer through thick foliage , safe in the knowledge that he could not be seen , and observe the work on the river bank . \\n when he raised his head , he was shocked at what he saw . \\n the figures he had spied from a distance were not men at work . \\n they were children . \\n there were maybe ten of them . \\n none of them was more than fifteen years old ; some of them looked very young indeed . \\n there were two adults with them -- a man and a woman -- who appeared to be in charge . \\n they stood around in a way that made will think of guards -- they looked bored and took no part in the work . \\n occasionally , one of them would bark a command at the children , ordering them to work harder . \\n the work , itself , looked backbreakingly hard for anyone , let alone children . \\n they were excavating the exposed bank of the river -- they had made a great deal of progress -- then breaking the rock into small lumps and loading it into barrels a few metres away . \\n will watched intently for a few minutes . \\n two boys -- ten years old ? \\n -- grasped a high pressure hose between them and , with difficulty , trained it on the base of the river bank , blasting great chunks from the ground . \\n five others -- three girls and two boys -- scampered in under the spray from the hose and gathered lumps of rock and clay , taking them to a point where two more children used lump hammers to break up the spoil . \\n this rubble was then taken by wheel barrow by two more boys to a row of oil drums which had been set up on a raised platform . \\n below that was a trough with a number of wires protruding from it . \\n intrigued , will watched as the rubble was added to one of the barrels , a boy hoisting it one bucket load at a time . \\n his partner then handed him a clear glass bottle from a wooden crate . \\n will recognised the label on the side of the crates stacked neatly beside the trough . \\n green leaf peaches , it read . \\n why were children pouring deadly poison on into barrels of rock and mud ? \\n when he had added ten or more bottles to the barrel , the boy stepped down and walked round to the front of the trough . \\n he reached over to one of the other barrels and turned on a tap that had been fixed near its base . \\n a sluggish stream of dirty liquid was released . \\n meanwhile , the other boy carefully lifted one of the wires from the trough . \\n it had a dull brown lump on the end , no bigger than a marble . \\n the boy snipped it off with a pair of pliers , placed it in a small basket and returned the wire to the trough . \\n bemused , will took in as much as he could , trying to make sense of what he saw . \\n a covert operation . \\n but what was being produced ? \\n why were children being used ? \\n where did they come from and how did they get here ? \\n after about an hour , the man on the bank produced a whistle and blew it . \\n the hose shut down and the children dropped to the ground relieved and exhausted . \\n a glance towards the camp revealed another adult to will . \\n a man was busily stoking the fire and arranging pots on it . \\n at least they feed them , thought will . \\n the children wearily made their way towards the camp . \\n one of them remained by the trough . \\n one of the guards walked over to him and asked him several questions . \\n he spoke too quietly for will to hear but it was clear he was making sure that all the wires had been pulled out of the trough and the marble-sized chunks harvested . \\n when he was satisfied , he knocked a wooden bung from the end of the trough and the liquid ran swiftly out of the hole , down a channel and into the river . \\n will nearly gave himself away . \\n that was poison going into the unspoiled waterways of suriname ! \\n now he had an explanation for the distressing sight he and harry had witnessed earlier . \\n this was criminal . \\n nothing could excuse this wanton damage . \\n not quite sure what to do , will decided to see what faced the children next . \\n it was starting to go dark . \\n at least they 'll get some rest , he thought . \\n it seemed , however , he was wrong . \\n after they had eaten a meagre meal , the trestle tables were cleared , and four naked bulbs came on , hanging from wires strung up under the canvass roof . \\n all the children remained seated . \\n the man who had been cooking brought a box from one of the huts and placed it on a table . \\n another box appeared and from it the children took out a number of paint pots and brushes . \\n at first , will thought he was seeing things . \\n what on earth was going on ? \\n could it be that this was the reward for all the hard work ? \\n then his bewilderment was increased . \\n from the first box , each of the children drew a small figure and bent to apply paint to it . \\n he could not be sure but , given the circumstances , will fancied the figures were tin soldiers . \\n what was bolt up to ? \\n the guards -- the two men and the woman -- retired to another fire on the other side of the clearing . \\n bottles were produced and , after ten minutes or so , laughter began to drift across the clearing . \\n the three of them sat drinking rum and smoking short , hand-rolled cigarettes , flicking the butts into the fire . \\n will decided to get a closer look at the activity at the trestle tables under the stark electric light . \\n he used the jungle as cover and moved round until he was able to approach one of the huts and sneak along the wall furthest from the light . \\n he peered round the corner . \\n he was only a few metres away from the children ; he could hear them muttering to each other . \\n they kept their voices low as if they were fearful of raising them . \\n certainly , a few of the younger ones looked nervously towards the guards from time to time . \\n all of them concentrated on their painting . \\n will was close enough now to see the figures and the colours being used . \\n they were the same as those he had seen in bolt 's office back at the apetina mine -- models of soldiers from the nineteenth century . \\n they brandished swords , held lances at the slope and sat astride chargers in their brilliant scarlet or prussian blue tunics . \\n he craned forward , not realising he was entering the circle of light cast by the bulbs hanging from the canvass roof . \\n his attention was taken by one of the girls . \\n she sat on the far side of the table , her back to the fire where the guards still sat and drank . \\n she held a small figure in her hands , applying paint carefully . \\n will realised she was older that most of the children there . \\n fifteen , sixteen ? \\n his age . \\n and she was quite stunningly beautiful . \\n will had had a few girlfriends at castlemead . \\n there was never anything serious , much more flirtatious than anything else . \\n and they had always parted amicably ; they had remained friends . \\n the girl had dark hair that hung below her shoulders and a fringe which framed a compassionate face . \\n the feature which intrigued will was her eyes . \\n they were deep brown with hazel highlights and they were staring straight into his . \\n he started . \\n she was looking directly at him . \\n quickly , he ducked behind the edge of the wall , knowing it was too late . \\n he heard her approaching footsteps crunch gently on the ground , and held his breath . \\n there was silence for a few seconds . \\n then a voice called softly from behind him . \\n he swung round . \\n her face appeared in the window opening of the hut behind which will had sought cover . \\n `` ol\\u00e1 ! \\n quem s\\u00e3o voc\\u00ea ? '' \\n she whispered . \\n will recognised the first word . \\n spanish , he thought . \\n `` spanish , no , '' he shook his head , whispering back . \\n `` english ? '' \\n he tried . \\n a look of recognition appeared on the girl 's face . \\n `` ingleesh . \\n you are americano ? '' \\n `` no , english , '' will said . \\n `` you speak english ? '' \\n `` a leetle , '' the girl said , keeping her voice low . \\n `` who are you ? \\n why you here ? '' \\n `` why are you here ? \\n what is this place ? '' \\n `` we need help . \\n we are trapped . \\n they make us work . '' \\n she gestured with her chin , indicating the guards . \\n `` they ca n't do that . '' \\n will was outraged . \\n `` why do n't you leave ? '' \\n `` where would we go ? '' \\n asked the girl . \\n `` thee jungle ees our prison . '' \\n immediately , will saw the sense of this . \\n even if the guards did nothing to prevent the children from leaving , they would last no more than a day or two . \\n they had no idea where they were ; no inkling about how to get to safety . \\n `` how did you get here ? \\n what are they making you do ? '' \\n will was trying to make sense of the strange set-up . \\n `` wait ! '' \\n the girl hissed . \\n she disappeared for a few moments . \\n when she returned , she explained : `` i theenk i hear sometheeng . \\n but ees all right . \\n i tell you quickly , then i must go back . '' \\n `` what is your name ? '' \\n `` i am constan\\u00e7a romero . \\n you ? \\n `` will greene . '' \\n `` you are from eengland , weell-green ? '' \\n asked constan\\u00e7a . \\n he nodded . \\n `` i am from rio in brazil . \\n thee man he say he weell give us work , pay us much dollars . \\n my father , he agree . \\n we come to thee jungle and work hard . \\n thee man he say he send money back to brazil . \\n he say our parents are pleased . \\n our father he wants us to work harder , get more dollars . '' \\n `` your father knows about this ? '' \\n will asked , shocked . \\n `` we are poor . \\n we live in thee favela on the hills above rio . \\n there ees no work . \\n when thee man he comes and he say much work , much dollars , our father he say ` good ' . \\n thee man he say only one month . '' \\n `` how long have you been here ? '' \\n `` much months . \\n three ? \\n four ? \\n you weell help us ? '' \\n what could he say ? \\n he nodded , not knowing what he might do . \\n there were ten or twelve children . \\n even if he were able to get them away from the guards , there was no way they could all fit in the raptor . \\n anything he was able to do would involve going to get help . \\n `` what are you working at ? \\n what are they making you do ? '' \\n he asked . \\n constan\\u00e7a said one word : `` gold . '' \\n chapter twenty before will had time to reply , constan\\u00e7a gasped and disappeared once more . \\n this time there came the bark of one of the guards . \\n constan\\u00e7a replied and will heard her re-join the other kids at the trestle table . \\n peering round the edge of the hut , once more , he saw the man who had cooked admonishing constan\\u00e7a , ordering her back to her painting . \\n he willed her to look his way again , but her eyes remained on the figure in her hand . \\n the guard , stick in hand , shouted something to the other two adults and walked to the hut with the smoking chimney . \\n he disappeared , closing the door behind him . \\n will sat back against the tin shed . \\n in the space of an hour , he had learned a lot about the darker side of adolphus bolt . \\n he , presumably , was `` thee man '' . \\n will rapidly put together the facts . \\n bolt was mining gold -- illegally -- from the surinamese jungle , using the apetina mine as cover . \\n he was also using zmi to supply the chemicals for the process that was rigged up by the river ; and those chemicals were being flushed into the fragile ecosystem with absolutely no regard for the environment . \\n effectively , he was also using child labour , holding the children against their will and -- this was the diabolical bit -- and with the full consent of their parents . \\n no missing children reports , no kidnapping charges . \\n no wages to pay . \\n will speculated that bolt could send minimal amounts to the poor parents in rio -lrb- if he bothered at all -rrb- which would keep them happy . \\n he 'd heard of favelas . \\n they were the slums of rio de janeiro , populated by huge numbers of the poorest of the poor , people with no rights and no voice . \\n meanwhile , bolt 's costs were minute . \\n he must be making a fortune . \\n will had to get away . \\n he withdrew into the jungle , planning to skirt the camp , get back to the boat and make a dash for safety . \\n curiosity , however , got the better of him . \\n as he drew level with the third hut , the one with the smoking chimney , he had an overwhelming urge to see what went on inside it . \\n he had a good idea but he wanted one of the blanks of bolt 's operation filled in . \\n sure enough , as he cautiously peered through the window , he saw the guard at his real work . \\n the hut had been turned into a workshop . \\n the man was busy at a stove which he was using to melt the raw gold -- the marble-sized lumps from the trough of potassium cyanide -- in a ceramic crucible . \\n as will spied , the man took the crucible in a pair of metal tongs and carefully poured the fiery yellow liquid into a series of moulds . \\n after a few minutes , he dipped the moulds into a barrel of water , extracted them and broke them open . \\n from each fell a collection of toy soldiers , beautiful representations in shiny yellow metal . \\n the final piece of bolt 's scheme fell into place . \\n it would be very difficult to smuggle gold out of the country without disguising it . \\n very dangerous , too . \\n but , conceal it in plain sight ... that was clever . \\n will could picture the scene if and when the cases were opened at the airport : `` just my hobby , officer , '' bolt would say . \\n `` yes , they are exquisite , are n't they ? \\n i am an old history buff . \\n you are interested , too ? \\n yes , yes , do have a closer look . \\n here , look at the detail . \\n amazing how accurate they are . '' \\n and the customs official would stand aside , perhaps thinking that the man before him was a little old to be playing with toy soldiers , but smiling , nevertheless , and wishing him well . \\n off bolt would go to make arrangements for the re-melting and sale of the gold . \\n will drew the model canon from his pocket . \\n he picked up a stone and scraped the barrel of the canon . \\n yellow gleamed through as the paint flaked off . \\n he wondered which of the children had painted his canon . \\n and bolt had hundreds of these models . \\n will checked the time . \\n the darkness was full ; it was after eight o\\u2019clock . \\n his priority was to get back to the boat and join harry . \\n at first light , they would leave for brokopondo . \\n he slipped noiselessly away from the camp and down towards the river . \\n it was up to him to get help for the children that bolt had enslaved . \\n he needed also to tell his father of bolt 's unsuitability as a mine manager . \\n the man was clearly devious and not concerned about using company money to fund his scheme . \\n and the last thing any business needs is to be caught up in illegal activity . \\n alan greene needed to distance his new venture from the apetina mine . \\n at the very least , he needed to remove bolt from the operation . \\n as the noise of the generator faded behind him , will passed the jetty and set off along the bank . \\n he had only the light of a crescent moon to see by . \\n fortunately , it glinted off the river and gave him something to follow . \\n he paused as he heard the gentle growl of an outboard motor . \\n somewhere ahead a boat was nosing along the bank , feeling its way gingerly in the dark . \\n will silently cursed his brother . \\n he 'd impressed upon him the folly of trying to navigate the river in the dark . \\n will was annoyed because he had let harry operate the boat on the understanding that he do so responsibly . \\n he checked behind him . \\n he was a safe distance from the camp . \\n he cupped his hands round his mouth and called : `` harry ! \\n here i am . '' \\n he had to raise his voice to be heard over the idling motor . \\n immediately , the pitch of the motor rose and will could make out a shadow , darker than the night , on the water . \\n the boat turned towards the bank . \\n at least he would not have to walk all the way back upstream . \\n perhaps he 'd go easy on his brother . \\n after all , they must get back to civilisation as soon as possible . \\n `` hurry up , harry . \\n come on , '' will called . \\n he was excited at the prospect of relating his discovery to his brother . \\n a beam of light cut across the water . \\n after the darkness , will was temporarily dazzled . \\n somewhere at the back of his mind something told him that the raptor was not fitted with searchlights . \\n too late he realised that this was some other boat . \\n at the same time a voice he recognised came clearly across the water . \\n `` well , well , well . \\n what ` ave we got ` ere ? '' \\n it was adolphus bolt . \\n `` boy , i advise you in the strongest possible terms , not to move one inch . \\n you are currently in the cross hairs of my rifle scope . \\n one false move and i will shoot you . '' \\n tempted to run though he was , will stood his ground . \\n he felt slightly sick at the thought that bolt had captured him . \\n bolt knew the jungle ; will was a novice . \\n the sickness turned to embarrassment at the thoughts he had been having only a few minutes earlier . \\n he had allowed his mind to consider the success of his mission , the news he would take to his father and , truth be told , he had thought about returning to rescue the children and impressing constan\\u00e7a . \\n now , he felt utterly wretched and not a little foolish . \\n as the boat touched the river bank , bolt stepped ashore . \\n `` take her on to the jetty , '' he instructed the driver . \\n `` do n't lose ` im . \\n slippery little fella , '' came a voice from behind the light . \\n it was axel hoover , bolt 's hunting partner . \\n `` do n't you worry about that , mate , '' bolt muttered . \\n he addressed will . \\n `` you want to stick your nose in where it 's not wanted ? \\n i warned you to get going . \\n now you 're in trouble . \\n turn about , boy . \\n and march . '' \\n bolt gestured with his rifle . \\n will had no choice but to retrace his steps once more . \\n *** sitting on a wooden crate in the storage shed close to the jetty , with only a weak electric light bulb for company , will had time to sit with his thoughts . \\n his initial feelings about bolt , back at the apetina mine , had underestimated the man 's character . \\n he was more than a bully -- that much was clear . \\n he had all but kicked will into the middle of the camp he 'd set up to mine gold . \\n he had berated the two guards sitting drinking , telling them that they had allowed a boy to sneak up on them , to spy on them . \\n he had been somewhat soothed when the other man had emerged from the workshop bearing another batch of toy soldiers for the children to paint . \\n will noticed how his eyes had lit up at the sight of the gold . \\n he ordered the unloading of the supplies he had brought up river -- three of the boys were dispatched under the supervision of one of the guards to empty the boat . \\n then he turned his attention to will . \\n `` you want to see how i operate , eh ? \\n you ` ad a good look round at the apetina . '' \\n bolt had prodded will with his rifle as he struggled to rise from the dust where he had stumbled . \\n `` you ` ad to snoop . \\n right -- you want to know what goes on ? \\n i 'll show you . \\n for rather obvious reasons i do n't get to tell many people what i do here . \\n come . '' \\n he switched on a powerful torch and , leaving the pool of light which spilled from the electric bulbs over the table , dragged will down to the water 's edge . \\n he dropped to one knee and took a handful of mud from the still damp ground which had been hosed earlier in the day . \\n `` this , '' he said , `` is gold-bearing rock and mud . \\n i recognised it immediately . \\n i have worked similar deposits in south africa . \\n there is a lot of gold here . \\n but it is in tiny bits . \\n very impractical . \\n but there is a way round it if you do n't mind the hard work . '' \\n he paused , a cruel smile on his lips . \\n `` or if you can get someone to do it for you . '' \\n he strolled over to the area where the barrels had been rigged up . \\n `` crush the rubble and pass a suitable solvent through it , the gold particles dissolve , and it is all made very possible . \\n see the wires ? '' \\n he indicated the trough with the lengths of cable sticking out of it . \\n `` electrolysis . \\n that 's the process that gets the gold out of the solution . \\n simple . \\n pass a current through the cyanide and the gold sticks to the wires . \\n hey presto ! \\n do n't ask me how it works . \\n it just does . '' \\n will had not been about to ask . \\n in fact , he was familiar with the process . \\n he recalled an experiment from the chemistry lab at school . \\n then , he had not been extracting gold , but the principle was the same . \\n `` it 's all very well getting the gold out of the ground , '' bolt continued as he strolled across the camp to the workshop . \\n `` getting it out of the country is the tricky bit . \\n the government here guards its mineral reserves jealously . \\n look at all the paperwork , the licences , the dockets and permissions i have to work through , just to get bauxite out of the ground . \\n at least i do n't have to pay for that . \\n zmi foot the bill . '' \\n will , who had been silent during bolt 's impromptu guided tour of his ego , decided the time was right for comment . \\n `` do n't you think that 's relevant ? \\n you 're using other people 's money to steal this country 's wealth . \\n that 's not business , that 's straightforward theft . '' \\n `` at what point did i claim to be honest ? '' \\n will realised he was being taunted , but continued , nevertheless . \\n `` you 're using child labour ! '' \\n `` correct , '' replied bolt , sounding pleased . \\n `` dirt cheap . \\n and , i may add , a stroke of genius getting the kids from the hell-holes of rio de janeiro . \\n no one cares for these brats . \\n they do n't exist . \\n if they work hard , i may get them back to their slums . '' \\n he looked sideways at will and will realised , at that moment , bolt was deranged . \\n `` or maybe , '' he smiled , `` i 'll pop ` em in the river ; feed the fish . '' \\n will knew there was no point in trying to reason with a madman but he was a normal human being and his anger got the better of him . \\n `` there wo n't be any fish left if you carry on dumping poison in the water . '' \\n `` shut it , '' bolt snarled . \\n he suddenly wheeled on will . \\n they were at the edge of the camp and , for a moment it looked as though bolt was about to hit will . \\n there was a maniacal glint in bolt 's eye as it caught the light from the fire . \\n then a leer replaced the curled lip . \\n `` listen , boy . \\n this little scheme is fool-proof ; there 's no one outside this camp knows anything about it . \\n not the police , not the government , not zmi . \\n we 're in the middle of the jungle . \\n the only law is my law . \\n i found this site . \\n i found the gold . \\n and i came up with the plan to get the gold out without arousing suspicion . \\n you got to admire it , hey ? \\n all i got to do is pretend to be one of those model soldier nerds . \\n the customs do n't want to talk to loonies . '' \\n will could contain himself no longer . \\n he was playing back the scene in his head and it reminded him of so many corny films he 'd seen . \\n the baddie always told the good guy what he was up to before it all started to go wrong . \\n when will pointed this out , bolt merely smiled . \\n `` the reason why i have told you is that there is no chance of any of the information leaving this jungle . \\n the reason for that is simple : you wo n't be leaving the jungle . '' \\n will was about to protest but bolt went on in a chilling manner . \\n `` do not think that your disappearance will cause too much of a stir . \\n i already know what i will say to your distraught father . '' \\n bolt adopted a fake look of compassion . \\n `` mr greene , i am so sorry . \\n my men have been out looking for your sons . \\n sadly , there is no sign . \\n we have found their boat . \\n it was overturned . \\n it is most unusual to recover bodies from the river . '' \\n `` do you expect me to roll over and die ? '' \\n will asked more bravely than he felt . \\n it was clear that bolt had had enough of the subject . \\n he beckoned axel hoover . \\n as the australian disengaged himself from the conversation at the camp fire , bolt turned back to will . \\n `` i expect you to run for your life as i hunt you . \\n i expect you to make a mistake and i expect you to die instantly as my aim is very good . \\n so , no . \\n no rolling over ; just dying . '' \\n he switched his attention to hoover . \\n `` take him to the store . \\n lock him in . '' \\n `` what about ` is brother ? '' \\n queried hoover . \\n `` do n't worry about him . \\n he 'll be camped upstream a little way . \\n we pick ` im up in the morning . \\n two to hunt , eh ? '' \\n chapter twenty-one will examined his surroundings for the tenth time . \\n the store was sturdily built and stacked with crates and jerry cans . \\n but there was nothing he could use to dig or force a way out . \\n the earthen floor was rock hard and he 'd torn his finger nails futilely scraping at it earlier . \\n he had already put his shoulder to the door several times . \\n it stood solidly , barred on the outside . \\n he sat and waited , trying not to think about what the morning held for him . \\n his english master at school had , some years ago , read the class a very sad book set during the first world war . \\n a soldier had been unfairly convicted at a court martial of disobeying orders and had spent several nights awaiting execution . \\n the whole class had discussed how that might have felt . \\n of course , it was impossible for them to imagine what had gone through the poor man 's head . \\n will now found himself in a very similar situation . \\n it took all his resolve not to panic . \\n he thought instead about his brother . \\n there was no way he could warn him . \\n he decided grimly that if bolt marched him through the jungle at first light , he would do his best to shout a warning to his brother . \\n that way , one of them might survive . \\n despite the fear in his mind , fatigue finally caught up with him . \\n he had not intended to sleep , but the mind often does the best thing to protect itself . \\n his eyelids drooped and he dozed . \\n something woke him . \\n even as he opened his eyes and took in the weak light filtering into the store , he cursed the fact that he had not fought the desire to sleep more fiercely . \\n he was still in that hazy zone where sleep and wakefulness meet and merge . \\n the scraping sound could be a chair being dragged across a dream or an alarm buzzer distorted by the brain 's infinite ability to twist perception . \\n there was a moment when will had no real idea about the origin of the noise , and another moment , only a fraction of a second later , when he knew the bar was being drawn from the outside of the door . \\n that woke him up properly . \\n the grey shafts of light which penetrated the cracks between the overlapping corrugated iron of the store heralded the dawn . \\n this could be his last morning . \\n he swallowed to stifle the tiny cry that threatened to escape his throat . \\n as the door creaked open , will realised that he should have been poised , spider-like , over the entrance ; or , at least , coiled like a cobra , ready to strike , behind the door . \\n he was neither . \\n futile though it might have been to rush a man with a gun , he at least felt he should try something . \\n groggy from the sleep he 'd so clearly needed , all he managed to do was look to the door . \\n silhouetted in the rectangular grey light of the morning , was constan\\u00e7a . \\n will came to his feet very quickly . \\n she stepped lightly inside and pulled the door to , raising a finger to her lips . \\n `` we have very leetle time , '' she whispered . \\n `` i hear what thee man ees going to do to you . \\n he talk to thee others . '' \\n `` how did you get here without being seen ? '' \\n `` they drink much rum . \\n every night ees same . \\n only one stay to watch . \\n in the end , he sleep also . \\n thees ees the only time for to eescape . '' \\n will looked at her . \\n `` thank you , '' he said , simply . \\n `` when you are free , promise me you weel get help . '' \\n constan\\u00e7a 's eyes implored will . \\n for a second he was lost for words . \\n then : `` come with me . \\n i have a boat . \\n we 'll get away together . '' \\n he stepped towards her , but she shrank back . \\n `` no . \\n marcos , my leetle brother , he ees here . \\n i have made promise to my father to stay weeth heem . \\n but eef you go , you weel get help ? '' \\n will , realising there was no time for persuasion or further discussion , nodded . \\n `` of course , '' he assured her . \\n `` it ees good . '' \\n she stepped aside and they cautiously pushed the door open , stepping out and replacing the bar . \\n quickly , they moved to the rear of the store so they would not be seen from the camp . \\n will wanted to stay , to talk to the girl . \\n he wanted to see whether there was any way her brother could be brought out so all three might melt into the jungle . \\n constan\\u00e7a stood firm , however . \\n she insisted he leave right away . \\n `` thee man , he awakes early . \\n he kicks thee others from their beds . \\n he shouts for work to begin . \\n you have leetle time only . '' \\n `` constan\\u00e7a , listen . \\n i promise i will come back for you , '' will said , earnestly . \\n `` i will do all i can to get you -- all of you -- out of here . '' \\n in reply , the girl leaned towards him and placed a kiss on his cheek . \\n then she was gone , moving lightly around the store and back to the camp . \\n will watched her go . \\n he watched her all the way back to the hut which the children shared , then let out a breath . \\n he wondered how much of a head start he had . \\n she had saved his life ; it was up to him now to repay the debt . \\n the door of one of the other huts suddenly creaked open . \\n axel hoover stepped out . \\n he screwed his eyes up in the early light . \\n he was pulling on his trousers and wearing an old t-shirt . \\n he walked unsteadily across the camp towards will 's hiding place , whistling . \\n it was not a terribly good rendition , but will recognised the strains of waltzing matilda . \\n he resisted the urge to run . \\n clearly , hoover had not spotted him . \\n if he broke for the trees , he would be seen . \\n he watched as the man gingerly crossed the clearing . \\n he was barefooted . \\n hoover approached the store and , ignoring the door , unzipped his fly and proceeded to urinate against the side of it . \\n the tinny noise accompanied him as he launched into a quiet , taunting version of a hunting we will go . \\n there were a lot of sadists in this part of suriname , will thought . \\n a hunting we will go , a hunting we will go , heigh ho , the dairy-o , a hunting we will go ! \\n a hunting we will go , a hunting we will go , we 'll catch a fox and put him in a box , and then we 'll let him go ! \\n `` except we wo n't let you go , boy . \\n d\\u2019you ` ere ? '' \\n the australian concluded with a chuckle . \\n he began again . \\n will backed away along the edge of the store . \\n if hoover were planning to check up on him , it would be better if will disappeared . \\n as he crept away , his shirt caught on the edge of a rusty piece of corrugated iron . \\n before he realised he was snagged , the metal snapped off the wall of the store with an awful noise which sang through the walls of the hut . \\n will froze . \\n not so hoover . \\n his song ceased abruptly . \\n and his face appeared round the corner of the store . \\n first surprise , then anger registered in his eyes . \\n `` how 'd you get out , boy ? \\n come ` ere . '' \\n the australian hobbled towards will . \\n this time , there was no hesitation . \\n will bolted like a whippet . \\n immediately , hoover began to shout , alerting the camp to the escape . \\n `` dolph ! \\n dolph ! \\n the boy 's ` avin ' it away on ` is toes ! '' \\n blood pumping in his ears , will left the camp as he plunged into the forest . \\n he was a good strong runner -- cross-country was his discipline of choice -- but he knew this race was for his life . \\n his headlong progress was given extra impetus by the picture in his mind of the camp in uproar : hoover limping back , shouting all the time ; bleary-eyed guards tumbling from their beds ; bolt stumbling out to see what the fuss was about ; then the frantic effort to drag on boots , collect rifles and to set off in hot pursuit . \\n will ran as he had never run before , leaping roots and fallen branches , ducking under hanging foliage , jinking round trees . \\n his breath came out raggedly , his arms pumped rhythmically at his sides . \\n he ran for himself , for his brother and for constan\\u00e7a . \\n he ran and ran . \\n *** harry woke as will burst through the vegetation on to the shingle of the beach . \\n the race had been hard and terrifying for the older boy . \\n one or two speculative shots from bolt or hoover had kept him at breakneck speed . \\n he was amazed that they had come after him so quickly . \\n when the first round had cracked into a tree a metre above his head , he realised that the sightlines in the jungle were not as obscured as he had hoped . \\n in fact , the hunters had caught only the merest glimpse of the fleeing figure but , nevertheless , tried their luck . \\n he leapt at the forest , ploughing through the undergrowth , breath ripping from him in the cool dawn . \\n harry had not set up a camp the previous evening ; he had not intended to sleep for long when he had lain on the floor of the raptor using a rolled hammock for a pillow . \\n the exertions of the day had taken their toll and he had just wanted to rest his eyes for an hour or so while he waited for his brother to return . \\n however , he had slept soundly through the night . \\n for a moment , he thought he was dreaming . \\n will was shouting about getting the boat into the water , about being shot at , about leaving fast . \\n when he heard the first rifle shot , harry realised he was awake and that it would be wise to take his brother 's advice . \\n he jumped out on to the shore just as will skidded to a halt beside the raptor . \\n `` no time , '' gasped will . \\n `` bolt . \\n shooting . \\n real bullets . \\n push ! '' \\n shoulders to the gunwales , the brothers heaved the raptor off the shingle and into the water . \\n harry vaulted on board and punched the starter . \\n so keen was he to move , that he nearly left will behind as he opened the throttle and heeled the raptor over into a tight turn . \\n will was dragged into the water and , only after the boat started making headway , managed to haul himself on board . \\n the two men hit the shingle and , in unison , raised their rifles . \\n a pair of shots rang out , splitting the air above the raptor . \\n both boys ducked their heads . \\n harry pushed the throttle as far as it would go and the raptor tore through the water heading away from the shore . \\n bolt and hoover were both breathing heavily after their run through the forest and neither was able to aim with any accuracy . \\n for the moment , the brothers were safe . \\n both had tales to tell , but they concentrated on getting as far from the hunters as possible . \\n it was not until they had rounded the bend and bolt and hoover were out of sight that they had time to draw breath and explain what the previous twelve hours had held for each of them . \\n rapidly , they exchanged stories . \\n harry was astonished that bolt had followed them until he had learned of the gold mine ; he was as outraged as his brother that children were being forced to work . \\n will congratulated harry on his discovery of the fungus . \\n he peered at the dull , crushed matter in the container , which harry proudly showed him , wondering whether it really could be as important as the professor hoped . \\n then they set their minds to escaping the jungle with their lives . \\n will was in no doubt that they would be pursued . \\n he outlined his view of their predicament . \\n `` we 've got a twenty minute start , i reckon . \\n bolt will come after us . \\n he has a better , faster boat . \\n and he has a gun . \\n we have to get to safety . \\n he will kill us if he gets the chance . \\n he 's got too much to lose . '' \\n it was a stark prospect they faced . \\n but what choice had they ? \\n though will tried the satellite phone again and again , still he could not raise a signal . \\n assuming they got out of the jungle , he thought , hyper-systems would be needing to make some improvements . \\n the raptor sped past the concealed backwater which led to the gold mine . \\n harry kept as far from that bank as possible . \\n they half expected bolt and hoover to come bursting forth at full throttle , guns blazing . \\n however , all was quiet . \\n their pursuers would waste precious time retracing their steps to their boat before they could begin to give chase . \\n the brothers began to breathe more easily with every moment they were alone . \\n they began to think that , perhaps , for some reason , bolt would leave them . \\n that illusion was shattered as bolt 's boat hammered round a bend two hundred metres behind them . \\n it was fast . \\n much faster than the raptor . \\n whatever engine he had on his boat , bolt was burning through fuel . \\n he was determined to catch the boys . \\n as they tried to squeeze the last bit of power from the mercury , will and harry had to concede that bolt was gaining visibly . \\n at this rate , will estimated they would be overhauled in a few minutes . \\n as if to underline the brothers ' fate , bolt let loose a couple of shots , while hoover tried to hold the boat as steady as he could . \\n a lucky round hit the back of the boys ' boat , smashing the plastic moulding on the stern , sending splinters flying . \\n their time was running out . \\n will looked wildly ahead , desperate for some means of escape . \\n instead , and with a sinking heart , he saw the head of the system of rapids which , the day before , they had picked their way up so painstakingly . \\n will knew that once the raptor attempted that route , there were two possible outcomes : either they slowed right down and attempted to avoid all the rocks , tried to plot a considered course down to safety -lrb- a kilometre away -rrb- , a course of action which would leave them sitting targets for a marksman like bolt ; or they could try to maintain their speed which would result in a suicidal collision . \\n if the impact did n't kill them , or if they failed to drown , it would be a small matter for bolt to find their battered bodies and ensure they were stone dead . \\n the caiman and piranha would deal with their corpses . \\n for an agonising few moments , will was unable to act , unable to think , unable to make a decision . \\n as the fast boat behind them swept downstream like a howling banshee , it was harry who took the initiative . \\n the raptor had been idling , the mercury sputtering , as they gazed first down the rock-strewn roller coaster of the rapids , then at the approaching menace behind them . \\n harry rammed the throttle forward and spun the wheel hard to the left . \\n the raptor responded nimbly and will , who had not been expecting the sudden jerk , grabbed desperately at the rail . \\n the question which entered his head , as he realised he had not been thrown into the river , was answered before he could articulate it . \\n harry had turned the boat away from the rapids and was heading at full speed down the other route taken by the river . \\n into the unknown was better -- marginally -- than the outcome which awaited them amongst the rocks . \\n in just a minute , the raptor had left the waters they knew and was approaching a bend . \\n the flow here seemed fast and was completely free from rocks . \\n still , they were not clear of danger : hoover knew how to navigate the river , would know which currents to favour and how best to catch them . \\n neither harry nor will dared to think any further ahead than the next bend , the next stretch of open water . \\n both knew , however , that there were well over 200 kilometres of twisting bending watercourse between them and the safety of the brokopondo dam . \\n will considered the possibility of landing and of the two of them heading into the forest for cover . \\n they would have a couple of minutes ' head start at most . \\n as he weighed up the slim range of choices , he glanced back at their pursuers . \\n was it his imagination , or had harry opened up a bigger lead ? \\n still looking for a way out , will watched as the boat behind them slowed and turned broadside . \\n over his shoulder , harry let out a cheer . \\n `` they 've given up ! \\n we 've made it ! '' \\n the crack of a high velocity round as it rent the air above them made both boys flinch . \\n bolt was resting his rifle on the side of the superstructure in an attempt to give him the chance of a steady shot . \\n he loosed off two more before will saw him turn to hoover . \\n their boat came round to face the boys ' boat and advanced . \\n now , however , hoover was content to meander , turning the boat from side to side , taking much of the broad sweep of the river . \\n harry kept the raptor at speed and soon they were far enough round the next bend to have lost sight of bolt and hoover . \\n harry slowed a little and craned his neck , peering back up river . \\n `` they 've had enough , '' he crowed . \\n `` we 're too fast for them . '' \\n he gave the console an affectionate pat . \\n will returned his brother 's triumphant grin but he still had some reservations . \\n bolt had convinced him that he was in mortal danger . \\n bolt had a lot to lose , not least his position with zmi . \\n and bolt had had a look on his face when he had explained will 's demise to him that was demented . \\n the other boat swept into view . \\n `` keep going , '' will instructed harry , unnecessarily . \\n hoover was doing nothing but keeping the raptor in plain sight . \\n he seemed happy enough just staying two hundred metres behind . \\n harry 's elation was matched by will 's suspicion . \\n the older boy cast around for reasons why bolt would lay off . \\n the river was running faster , its surface like glass . \\n it seemed to be narrowing . \\n for a few minutes will studied the banks . \\n before harry had veered to the left , taking them down this branch of the river , there had been two hundred metres between the shores , and the forest had blurred the line between land and water . \\n now , it was clear to will , the river was narrowing -lrb- that would account for the faster flow as the water was forced into a narrower channel -rrb- . \\n and the banks were rising . \\n in the space of only a hundred metres , the raptor had entered a gorge , its walls growing higher and higher , the further the boys progressed . \\n soon , all they could see of the sky was a thin band of blue between the sheer cliffs which hemmed them in . \\n as if to forewarn of danger ahead , the temperature in the gorge dropped several degrees : this part of the forest seldom saw the sun . \\n they were on a straight stretch of water , heading for a right hand bend . \\n behind them , still laying off , bolt and hoover hovered a long way back . \\n as they approached the bend in the river , they boys became aware of a curious noise . \\n the water swept round in front of them , speeding up still more , as it was funnelled between the rock walls , no more than twenty metres apart . \\n then , the river disappeared ! \\n confusion and the terror of understanding hit will simultaneously . \\n how could a river disappear ? \\n by plunging straight down from a precipice . \\n the raptor was careering straight to the brink of a waterfall . \\n seeking the shortest way downhill , the river simply burst from the constriction of the rock walls and shot into space . \\n it had carved itself a beautifully smooth chute and poured , almost unchecked , into the void . \\n the noise that the boys heard was the roar of millions of tons of water . \\n the roar echoed through the canyon , announcing the presence of the waterfall . \\n it was n't a warning as there was nowhere else for them to go -- more the knell of doom . \\n even as will realised that bolt and hoover would not be stupid enough to follow the boys into this peril , harry saw the danger and tried to spin the boat . \\n with the wheel at full lock , the raptor was unable to resist the power of the current . \\n it was inexorably swept towards the edge of oblivion . \\n choices went through will 's mind . \\n even if they could turn back , they 'd be shot . \\n not an option . \\n get to the bank , climb away from the river . \\n they were going too fast ; the rock wall too sheer and too high . \\n swim for it . \\n same applied : not an option . \\n there was only one way . \\n they were going over the falls . \\n if they were to stand a chance , they had to go over bow first and at the right speed to keep the shallow keel level . \\n the trouble was , neither boy had any idea how fast to go nor how far they would fall . \\n -lrb- at the back of both their minds was the thought that it would not matter anyway if the falls crashed on to rocks below . -rrb- \\n will shouted instructions above the roar of the water . \\n harry accepted their fate . \\n he could see bolt 's boat idling now as it held back from the dangerous current as the river approached the falls . \\n even at that distance , he thought he could see the grimace on the man 's face . \\n he turned and concentrated on keeping the boat nose-on to the falls . \\n as they were swept forward , he gunned the motor . \\n in his mind , he had the thought of launching a paper plane into the air -- give it shove in an upward direction . \\n then they were there . \\n *** half a kilometre away , bolt cursed . \\n hoover looked surprised . \\n `` you wanted them dead . \\n what 's the problem ? '' \\n he asked . \\n `` the problem is , '' bolt explained through gritted teeth , `` that we now have to go all the way round to find out whether they died . \\n there 's no way we can get close enough to the falls without going over ourselves . \\n that is why i wanted to put a bullet in each of them . \\n with a bullet , you are sure . '' \\n `` it 's a big fall , mate , '' hoover said , hopefully . \\n `` their boat could 've flipped . \\n they should 've hit the rocks . \\n splat ! \\n no more kids , you get me ? \\n they would 've drowned even if they were n't killed outright . '' \\n bolt just stared at the falls . \\n `` could 've , should 've , would 've , '' he mused . \\n `` but we do n't know for sure . '' \\n he turned to hoover . \\n `` get this boat back up the river . \\n we 've got to check . '' \\n chapter twenty-two one second the raptor was skimming the water , the next , it was airborne . \\n the rush of images came thick and fast : the green carpet of jungle beneath them ; the white cloud of spray which clung to the hull as the boat burst forward ; will diving for the deck , seeking a handhold ; the pool of churning water beneath them . \\n everything went quiet . \\n for harry , standing at the wheel , the whole perspective changed . \\n the raptor seemed to hang in the air for an age . \\n harry felt calm -- he had committed them to whatever fate had in store for them ; there was nothing he could do to alter it . \\n the fall seemed to go on and on and then -- with a mighty splash and a rush of returning sound -- they were down . \\n compared to the mad rush down the river , the fear of high velocity rounds and the strange , insane fall , the first moments at the foot of the falls were peaceful . \\n it helped that both boys were lying on the cool floor of the raptor -- will where he had thrown himself , harry where he had been thrown by the impact . \\n they had a minute to decide whether they were dead or alive . \\n both sat up at the same time , a bit bruised , a bit knocked about but , considering the stunt they 'd just pulled off , they were remarkably intact . \\n surprise was the greatest emotion they felt as they looked back to where they had come from . \\n the falls towered above them , not quite as tall as they had looked in the split second when the boat had shot over ; nevertheless , ten metres is a long drop . \\n in fact , two things had saved them -lrb- neither of which occurred to the boys at the time -rrb- . \\n their momentum had carried them far enough to avoid the maelstrom directly beneath the falls ; and the configuration of the raptor 's hull , designed for aquadynamic stability , had provided some aerodynamic stability -- at least enough to deliver the boat on to the water fairly flat . \\n after the initial shock , they began to take stock . \\n some of the lighter gear in the boat -- certainly that which had not been tied down -- had been lost overboard . \\n but the boys had been heavy enough to stay on board . \\n the boat was drifting away from the falls and harry quickly returned to the wheel . \\n the motor had been smothered by the splashdown and harry pushed the starter with some trepidation . \\n it spluttered , turned over and settled into its accustomed throb . \\n they exchanged looks tinged with nervous grins , neither trusting himself to talk just yet . \\n harry pointed the boat downstream and gave it a little throttle . \\n for much of the rest of the day , will and harry concentrated on putting as much distance between them and bolt as they could . \\n they knew their luck at the falls had bought them valuable time . \\n truth be told , had they not blundered into the waterfall , bolt would have overhauled them easily and -- well , the phrase `` fish in a barrel '' , came to mind . \\n the satellite phone had taken another bashing as will had rather carelessly left it loose on the deck but , as it had not been working anyway , it did n't seem to matter . \\n he cast the useless thing aside , disappointed . \\n he would have felt safer had he been able to relay some of the information about bolt to somebody else . \\n in particular , he wanted to make sure that , no matter what happened to him , he could somehow keep his promise to constan\\u00e7a . \\n when he took the wheel from harry , he suggested his brother try the laptop . \\n dutifully , harry tapped out an email and hit the send key . \\n almost immediately , the screen displayed a message informing him of insufficient network coverage . \\n `` useless , '' he muttered . \\n by mid-afternoon , they had regained the ezel . \\n the width of the main river added to their feeling of escape . \\n they no longer felt hemmed in by a brooding jungle which is what each had felt separately as they had fled bolt 's domain . \\n from here , the ezel meandered north towards the great brokopondo lake . \\n the vast size of the river was impressive . \\n its breadth varied considerably and it was difficult to estimate it accurately as there were countless islands -- large and small -- which cut the view as they neared the margins of the main channel . \\n the river proper was over a kilometre across . \\n this was where any industrial traffic moved , indeed , from a distance they saw one of the ore carriers that could only be on its way to the apetina mine . \\n towards each bank of the ezel , the water flowed in and around a system of sandbanks and more established islands , some of them several kilometres in length and thickly clothed in greenery . \\n will had suggested to harry that they steer a course which would allow them to disappear amongst this natural aquatic labyrinth should the need arise . \\n they were , perhaps , a hundred and fifty kilometres from the lake and ever mindful of pursuit ; will found it difficult not to peer back along the river every few minutes . \\n something at the back of his mind told him that he would , on one of these occasions , see the familiar shape of the general manager 's boat as hoover steered and bolt levelled his rifle once more . \\n but , as the day progressed , there was no sign of danger . \\n harry was the first to spot the lone figure on the beach . \\n at first , will , peering forward , refused to believe his brother . \\n but harry was pointing off to the side where the way was concealed by an island . \\n they left the main course of the ezel and dipped into the inland delta created by a huge sweeping bend covering many kilometres and several hundred hectares . \\n while the main river swept majestically by , a self-contained ecosystem coexisted just beyond the main flow . \\n will recognised the formation into which they had navigated . \\n the weight of the river travelling round a bend carves ever more exaggerated curves . \\n eventually -lrb- and this takes many hundreds of years -rrb- , the erosion connects the beginning of one bend with the end of the next . \\n the river steams majestically on , leaving a sluggish lake behind -- an ox-bow lake . \\n the ezel had created a complicated pattern of lakes which had remained connected to the main flow . \\n effectively , it was a series of smaller routes around isolated islands , away from the main river . \\n the flow had not slowed enough , yet , for the area to become a swamp . \\n that would come in time . \\n it was into this backwater that harry had nosed the raptor out of curiosity . \\n `` there 's a bloke there ! '' \\n harry exclaimed . \\n and so , after a few moments staring , there was , will had to agree . \\n at a distance of three or four hundred metres , there was nothing distinctive at all about the figure . \\n perhaps it was the obvious bulk of the body which led harry to assume it was a man . \\n he cut the motor to idle and allowed the craft to drift on the current in order to draw near cautiously . \\n the man sat , his back to the river , with his head in his hands , rocking to and fro . \\n the shore of his island had been eroded to a muddy beach . \\n will , always careful , glanced around and , in the natural setting , spotted an unnatural form . \\n `` he 's stranded , '' he told harry . \\n `` look . '' \\n he pointed away to the left . \\n `` there 's his boat -- what 's left of it . '' \\n sticking above the rushing water , where the river embraced the southern point of the island was the superstructure of a boat . \\n it must have been a craft of similar size to the greene boys ' boat . \\n but it had come to grief on a jagged root and had grounded out in the shallows . \\n `` hey ! '' \\n called harry . \\n he stood with one foot on the gunwale , grasping the handrail . \\n `` hey ! '' \\n he shouted , again . \\n the boat was now as close to the shore as will judged safe . \\n he turned to motor over , reversing the drift . \\n the throaty grunt of the mercury had an instant effect on the figure on the beach , now twenty metres from the boys . \\n he leapt to its feet . \\n there was a look of fear mingled with astonishment on the bearded face . \\n there was a brief pause before he flung out his arms and shouted a greeting : `` praise the good lord ! '' \\n *** mw had been sitting in abject despair on the muddy flat for several hours . \\n he had no idea of the exact time that had elapsed since he had been cast away in his own little nightmare . \\n the boat he had stolen from the apetina mine at least kept him out of the jungle proper . \\n all he had to do was tootle downstream . \\n he had supplies of normal food , tinned ; water , bottled . \\n there was really no need to engage any further with an environment which threatened at every turn to bite , sting or prick . \\n as for the men he 'd encountered ... they did n't bear thinking about . \\n mw had started to rue the day he had rescued the limey businessman , stone , from the prison riot . \\n sure , he 'd earned some decent money from jonas -lrb- much of it for doing nothing -rrb- . \\n but the job he 'd been given did not , at present , seem worth the trouble any more . \\n he had had to remind himself of two things . \\n one : stone was offering five million dollars for the job he had already done . \\n and two : if he could intercept the greene boys and relieve them of this magical fungus with all its healing properties , he could afford to cut all his ties with stone . \\n hell , he could afford to ignore the five mil ! \\n he had been around for long enough and had enough contacts to make him absolutely certain that he could pass on this extraordinary mushroom to an old college pal in the right industry who would see its potential . \\n there were billions to be made ! \\n it was while he had been day dreaming of the comfortable retirement that awaited him in the caribbean that his boat had hit a snag . \\n hard . \\n thrown forward into the steering wheel , he had been winded and , when he had gone over the side , he had barely the strength to reach the shore . \\n it had taken him some time to realise his transport was gone ; a little longer to accept the possibility that he might never get out of the jungle . \\n he dragged himself up to the drier part of the island , slipping in the mud and dropped to the ground to recover . \\n he had had quite a rough time over the last couple of days . \\n after recovering some of his strength and resolve , he had taken stock of his situation . \\n he had always been a man able to thrive on his wits -- the conman 's stock in trade -- but , as he had stumbled and crawled around his new domain , the sole inhabitant on an island no larger than two football pitches , he began to realise just how bleak his situation was . \\n he was stranded in the middle of a swirling river , hundreds of metres from the shore , in the heart of the loneliest , most desolate province of a poor country on a poor continent . \\n no one knew where he was . \\n no one even knew he had set out for suriname , save jonas stone who , no doubt , was in his well-appointed office suite in london , over seven thousand kilometres away . \\n mw 's options were limited . \\n he 'd never been a strong swimmer and the residents of the ezel -- caimans -- may be crocodiles of the smaller variety but were , nonetheless , rapacious reptiles armed with hundreds of razor-sharp teeth . \\n and his limited knowledge of tropical river systems included the fact that shoals of piranha patrolled the waters , always keen to strip the flesh from careless swimmers . \\n the boat was a wreck . \\n even the nicely packaged supplies were unobtainable , underwater . \\n the only thing he had managed to grab as he 'd half fallen , half leapt over the side of the boat , was his tote bag , which he now clutched to his chest as a mother might hold her baby . \\n and his chances of surviving on the island for more than a day or two -- no food , no shelter , only muddy river water -- were remote . \\n sitting with his head in his hands , he began to regret his previous conduct . \\n he knew , deep down , that he had not been good in the strictly recognised sense of the word . \\n he had relieved gullible people of their money ; he had committed many a violent act ; and he had had scant regard for the law of any land he had cared to visit . \\n it 's odd what reactions fear can generate in human beings . \\n in mw , it must have touched the soul of the reverend of the 99 saints for , as he sat there , he began to pray . \\n he prayed long and hard , making all sorts of promises to his god . \\n he 'd mend his ways ; he 'd do good work from now on ; he 'd be kinder to animals . \\n that sort of thing . \\n the only thing he asked for in return for this character transformation was a way off the island and a passage to the civilised world . \\n mw did not know how long he had been sitting in the mud when he heard the unmistakable noise of an outboard . \\n he leapt up , shouting to the boat that idled some metres away . \\n he squinted at the occupants of the craft . \\n it could n't be . \\n not possible . \\n it was . \\n it was the greene boys ! \\n gee whiz ! \\n he thought . \\n i 've been wondering how to get close to them without making them suspicious and now they find me . \\n he resolved to slip into character as the reverend for the meeting , conveniently forgetting all the promises he had just made . \\n will kept the motor ticking over as he assessed the situation . \\n unusual , he thought , even for this exotic location . \\n this was no native of the surinamese jungle . \\n he looked quite out of place and uncomfortable , too . \\n but , as he muttered to his brother : `` we 've got to help him . \\n but keep your eyes open and watch for anything suspicious . \\n all those warnings about stranger-danger apply out here , you know . '' \\n mw was effusive in his thanks as he hauled himself over the gunwale and flopped on to the floor of the raptor . \\n most of the mud had been washed off his clothes as he had waded quickly out to the boat and he sat recovering against the side , a gentle steam rising from him as the sun dried his shirt . \\n `` boys , you do n't know how grateful i am . '' \\n he had slipped into the southern drawl of the minister he was impersonating . \\n `` the good lord will surely bless you . \\n you would n't have a bite to eat for a poor sinner , would you ? \\n only , the good lord has tested this sinner . \\n i 've had no dinner . \\n it 's like the forty days and forty nights the lord jesus had to endure in the wilderness . '' \\n harry passed mw a snickers bar which mw consumed greedily . \\n between bites he answered will 's questions . \\n `` there are still heathen in this here jungle , my boy , who need to be brought to the lord . \\n i -- reverend dwayne dillinger -- have been called upon by the almighty to spread his word . \\n it is a task i perform with the most humble pride . \\n it is an honour to be chosen . \\n of course , it is sometimes difficult to understand the workings of the almighty but he musta had good reason to run me aground here . \\n maybe , '' and he looked up at the boys as he said it , `` maybe it was his will that i meet with you . '' \\n will chose to ignore this . \\n he spun the wheel and eased the raptor out into the current . \\n there was something not quite right about their passenger . \\n will could not say what but his brother , now he 'd had a closer look , was regarding the good reverend with a great deal of suspicion . \\n at the back of harry 's mind was a small warning bell which grew in intensity the longer he looked at the bearded man who was now adjusting his position and making himself comfortable . \\n perhaps if he had been more rested , he might have put the fragmentary images in his brain together sooner -- somehow , he felt , he knew this man -- but , as the raptor swept round the northern tip of the island and took the boys deeper into the delta , other things crowded in on his tired mind . \\n however , the whisper of doubt remained . \\n will and the reverend talked as they travelled . \\n will was taciturn , the reverend garrulous . \\n will heard all about reverend dillinger 's good works -- how he had saved countless natives in the jungle ; how he had turned down the soft option of a tennessee parish in order to do so ; and how , despite the rigours of life in the jungle , he embraced his work as he embraced the lord . \\n slowly , as will was a trusting sort of chap , he began to accept that the good reverend was deserving of his trust . \\n he may not have been the most effective preacher but his heart seemed to be in the right place . \\n harry , however , kept his own council ; something about their passenger unsettled him deeply . \\n chapter twenty-three will expected the journey to lake brokopondo to take until the middle of the next day . \\n there was no question of pushing on through the night . \\n they needed somewhere safe and unobtrusive to make camp . \\n trying to travel in the dark would be dangerous . \\n they would run the very serious risk of being holed by a floating log or of running aground -lrb- it had already happened to the good reverend -- and he 'd had god to guide him -rrb- . \\n as dusk dusted the jungle , harry took the raptor away from the main stream and sought some haven on the east bank of the ezel . \\n he settled on a heavily wooded protruding spur of land which allowed them to beach the boat behind a curtain of foliage . \\n there was little chance of bolt spotting them even if he were still following them . \\n they were on the inner curve , beyond the apex , of a sweeping bend which took the river from west to east . \\n the natural line for river traffic round this bend was seven or eight hundred metres out in the main current . \\n will felt secure as he and his brother went about the business of pitching their camp . \\n their unexpected passenger seemed oblivious of the need for everyone to lend a hand . \\n as harry hauled hammocks and mosquito nets from the boat and began to sling them up between convenient trees , and will set about heating a meal for them , reverend dillinger settled back against a tree trunk and pulled his hat over his eyes . \\n he misunderstood will 's sarcastic enquiry . \\n `` may i get you anything ? '' \\n the boy asked , an eyebrow arched . \\n `` do n't let me interrupt you , lad . \\n you get your chores done good ; i can wait for a coffee . \\n the good lord has given me the gift of patience . '' \\n mw had missed will 's smirk and had called after him : `` but , when you 're done , i 'll take three sugars . '' \\n will shushed harry 's reaction and they busied themselves preparing for the night . \\n `` say , boys , '' drawled mw , casually . \\n `` what brings you to the jungle ? \\n i mean , i 'm not trying to be rude , but you seem awful young to be here on your own . '' \\n will who , so far , thought they had done remarkably well , bristled slightly . \\n `` we 're assessing the environmental impact of bauxite mining . \\n for a major green investor . '' \\n `` that 's quite a responsibility . '' \\n `` there 's a mine some way up river . \\n we had to finish an inspection when the boss was injured in an accident . \\n now we 're on our way back to parbo to report . '' \\n `` no radio equipment ? '' \\n asked mw carelessly . \\n will took the sat phone from his pocket , clicked it on and , having checked the display , said : `` only this ; but it 's broken . '' \\n that was information that was useful for mw : no contact with the outside world . \\n `` what do you think of the jungle ? \\n anything interesting to report ? '' \\n will saw no reason to be guarded . \\n this , after all , was a missionary , a man whose existence was governed by helping those who had not yet been brought to christianity . \\n will was naturally inclined to be friendly . \\n `` we had a stroke of luck . \\n i do n't know whether you know , but the rainforest could hold countless plants and animals that might be used to help humans . \\n one of the reasons we looked at the mining operation was to make sure the environment was n't permanently damaged . '' \\n harry joined them , squatting beside the stove that will had used to heat their supper -- beans and bacon in a bag . \\n will passed a bag to his brother and one to mw , who made appreciative noises . \\n as they tucked in , will warmed to his theme . \\n he explained the request that had been made by the professor and then , with a broad proud smile on his face , told mw that harry had located the fungus . \\n harry pulled the bottle from his pocket and showed it off . \\n `` and that is going to make a difference to thousands of people , you say ? '' \\n mw sounded deeply impressed . \\n `` though , it do n't look like much . '' \\n he reached over for the bottle . \\n something made harry return it to his pocket . \\n `` i think i 'll keep it for the prof. '' mw ignored this and continued being friendly . \\n `` so , you two just set off on your own ? \\n i must say i am truly impressed . \\n young people today get a lot of bad press -- they ca n't be bothered , they 're too concerned with themselves , never willing to do anything for anyone else . \\n you two are a credit to your family . \\n i 'd be proud to have you as my sons . '' \\n they sat for a while , talking about the boys ' hopes , about the rest of the journey -- mw was careful to spend time thanking them for their kindness in rescuing him -- and will produced the requested coffee -lrb- though mw had to do without sugar -rrb- . \\n when the only light left was that from the leds in the rechargeable lamp which hung from a low branch , three weary travellers agreed to turn in . \\n half an hour later , only the sounds of the jungle drifted across the ezel . \\n *** something had disturbed harry . \\n he was still in the hazy drowse between sleep and wakefulness . \\n he felt relaxed and warm and could not work out why he was not still wrapped up in a dream with involved him and frank lampard combining to put chelsea ahead against manchester united in the dying moments of the fa cup semi-final . \\n without opening his eyes , he knew it was light . \\n the cool dew on his face told him it was very early . \\n then , he sat up with a start . \\n the noise was that of a motor coughing into life . \\n it was distant but distinct . \\n bolt and hoover had found the boys ; at the least , they were close . \\n harry rolled out of his hammock , clutching his trousers which he had hung over a branch . \\n he dragged them on and shuffled into his basketball boots , leaving the laces as he pushed through the undergrowth towards the river at a crouch . \\n he looked out across the calm waters . \\n there was a boat ! \\n it was only about twenty metres out . \\n harry 's first instinct was to duck out of sight . \\n his second instinct was to peer through the leaves , wondering why it was the raptor he saw . \\n he had expected to see bolt combing the shoreline , looking down the barrel of his rifle . \\n instead , there was the reverend dillinger , his back to the shore , pushing the starter , trying to get the motor to turn over . \\n harry stood , uncomprehendingly , for a few seconds . \\n he was about to call out , to find out what the reverend was doing , when the man turned round as the motor gave a healthy roar . \\n mw saw the boy immediately and gave him a wolfish grin and a cheery wave . \\n harry 's misgivings about the man instantly made sense to him as he realised where he had seen that image before . \\n the bearded face . \\n parbo , when the truck had nearly run down his father and again at the apetina mine after the accident . \\n `` thanks for everything , '' called mw across the calm morning water . \\n `` i 'll be seeing you boys . '' \\n he paused and then , the grin still on his face , shouted , cheerily , `` oh , perhaps i wo n't . \\n just remember what good you 've done the human race . '' \\n he held a small bottle high in the air for harry to see . \\n the fungus sample . \\n `` i got your old man second time round ; and it looks like i got you all in the end . '' \\n there was nothing for harry to say . \\n he simply watched as mw opened the throttle and turned the boat for the main stream of the river . \\n within a few minutes , the raptor reached the point in the next bend where it would be hidden from view . \\n mw turned for the last time to give the boy a mocking wave . \\n the noise of the mercury had died to almost nothing , so the sound of the other motor came clearly to harry . \\n he looked up river in time to see hoover at the helm of his boat and he heard , indistinctly , an excited yell from bolt , who was standing at the prow . \\n harry shrank back into the trees but maintained his vantage point enough to see bolt raise his rifle and take a couple of speculative shots at the distant raptor before mw disappeared from view . \\n as mw vanished round the bend , harry had the satisfaction of seeing the terror on his face . \\n he watched as hoover powered the boat down the river , urged on by bolt . \\n they swept by , a hundred metres out , little suspecting that they were chasing the right boat but that their true targets were on the bank , concealed by the jungle . \\n harry turned as will stumbled to his side . \\n `` what 's going on ? '' \\n he demanded blearily . \\n `` get back ! '' \\n harry tugged his brother down to his level . \\n strictly , that had n't been necessary . \\n bolt and hoover were already past their position and intent on the river as it flowed round the bend . \\n neither of them gave a glance towards the bank . \\n `` i thought we 'd lost them . \\n i thought they 'd have given up by now , '' will breathed . \\n `` but at least they 've gone . '' \\n `` so 's the raptor , '' harry informed him . \\n he related the scene that had greeted him when he had been woken , then filled will in on the part mw -- `` the reverend '' , as he knew him -- had played in the last few days . \\n `` why would someone want to kill us ? '' \\n will was unable to grasp entirely the implications of what his brother was suggesting . \\n had he been more awake , he would have realised how redundant his question was . \\n `` yes , '' said harry . \\n `` usually , only two psychos after you is enough . '' \\n he nodded in the direction of the rapidly disappearing bolt and hoover . \\n `` but then , in fairness , we did n't know about the good reverend until yesterday . '' \\n will ignored his brother 's sarcasm . \\n `` he 's also got the bottle with the fungus in it , '' harry added . \\n the brothers returned to their camp site , such as it was . \\n most of their gear had been in the raptor , including food and water . \\n they gathered all their possessions together . \\n they amounted to not a great deal for survival in the jungle . \\n a stove -- nothing to light it with ; one short machete ; three hammocks and nets ; the clothes they stood up in . \\n everything else was stowed aboard the raptor , currently property of the good reverend . \\n things looked bleak . \\n *** the sun rose . \\n the heat grew . \\n will worried . \\n he was ultimately responsible for the whole expedition , for his brother , for the information that his father needed and for professor ramsundar 's hopes . \\n it rather looked to will that , on all levels , he had failed . \\n `` cheer up , '' harry had told him . \\n `` i 'm going to see what i can see . \\n i 'm hungry . \\n you want anything in particular ? '' \\n `` big mac , '' will had said , without smiling . \\n harry had been gone for a half hour during which will had taken in the hammocks and realised they were of no use to them . \\n what they needed were marching rations , hats and water bottles . \\n the only slim chance they had was , it appeared to will , to walk out of the jungle . \\n he guessed that they would have to cover another hundred kilometres before they got to lake brokopondo . \\n the lake , itself , stretched for 40 kilometres , north to south . \\n that distance could easily be doubled if they were forced to follow its ragged shoreline . \\n the enormity of the task bore down on will and he began to despair . \\n he found himself pacing , trying not to allow their desperate situation get the better of him . \\n he told himself that they had managed to avoid the clutches of adolphus bolt , had survived the drop from the waterfall and found , albeit temporarily , the precious fungus . \\n he steeled himself for the task ahead of him . \\n but it seemed to have a dizzying effect upon him . \\n was it all too much ? \\n should he have insisted on carrying on without his father ? \\n he was only sixteen ; harry was only fourteen . \\n what had he been thinking ? \\n the ground moved beneath his feet . \\n he felt weak and beaten by the forest . \\n will had never fainted before , but now he lurched to the right , as though he were being pitched upon the sea . \\n he felt an irrational sense of humiliation if this was the way it was to end -- so overwhelmed by the situation that he was going to pass out . \\n he was glad his brother was n't there to see it . \\n `` next stop brokopondo ! '' \\n called harry . \\n he jogged back into the clearing where they had camped , the machete raised in salute . \\n will realised he was as clearheaded as ever . \\n the ground really was moving beneath him . \\n `` it 's a drifter , '' harry explained as he came to a halt . \\n `` it was snagged on the real bank . \\n i hacked away the root system of the tree that had caught and we 're off . \\n better than walking , eh ? '' \\n will pushed his way towards the river . \\n bizarrely , the ground on which he stood was keeping pace with the flow of the water -- no , it was floating on the current . \\n he took his bearings again and reassessed the position in which he found himself . \\n slowly , he realised what had happened . \\n they had moored , the previous night , without knowing it , on the edge of one of the great chunks of land torn off by the sibibusi , the great living islands which drifted down stream , propelled by the current until they snagged or were broken up . \\n for the time being , will and harry were rulers of their own tiny island territory . \\n harry walked his astonished brother round their kingdom . \\n it was about thirty-five metres long and densely packed with vegetation . \\n it seemed to be roughly oval on shape and , at what the boys immediately , though weirdly , thought of as the stern , were the remains of the roots that harry had hacked away . \\n as it drifted on the current , it twisted this was and that . \\n `` i was looking for a way through the jungle , '' he explained . \\n `` i followed the bank for a little way until i came across this . '' \\n he indicated the severed root system . \\n `` a little further along and i was coming back to where i had started from . \\n i realised it must be an island . \\n and look . '' \\n he poked at the edge of the ground beneath them . \\n `` there is no shingle . \\n this has not been here for long enough to settle and erode . \\n i guessed it was a drifter and hacked us lose . \\n welcome aboard the good ship lucky . '' \\n chapter twenty-four will took the time to examine the extraordinary craft on which they found themselves . \\n apart from the narrow clearing where they had camped for the night , it was densely clad in verdant jungle . \\n will recalled wondering a few days previously whether such drifters , as harry had dubbed the floating islands , could take sailors . \\n the boys had watched as the detritus of the sibibusi had washed past them -- some of it far out in the ezel ; a lot brushing the banks , threatening to clog up the shoreline . \\n it was strange . \\n after the initial lurch as harry had freed the island from the tangle of roots that had held it fast , their progress downstream had been stately . \\n happily , the current had carried them to the clear waters mid-stream : no more snags . \\n will grinned as he saw harry 's head and shoulders poking up through the treetops as he scanned the river ahead , like a pirate at the masthead . \\n there were a few disgruntled howls of protest from the monkeys that shared their island as one of the invaders dared to climb into their realm . \\n how would those monkeys feel when they found they had been torn from the land they knew and transported hundreds of kilometres ? \\n they travelled in this unconventional manner for much of the morning . \\n the sun was high and burning hot by the time they spotted the raptor . \\n it was aground on a beach . \\n the river , evidently , took a severe turn to the right as it rolled round the foot of a hill whose peak could be seen a little way inland . \\n in fact , it nearly doubled back on itself . \\n the result was that the boys ' island entered the natural lagoon created by the river 's progress . \\n if it had not been there , they would have floated helplessly by , leaving their boat behind . \\n quickly , they crouched in the long grass at the leading edge of the island , surveying the scene before them . \\n the lagoon extended into the jungle as the river struggled round a promontory which stood out at the foot of the hill . \\n it was as though the ezel had been in two minds -- had attempted to pass the hill to the west and , finding the ground rising , had taken the easier route to the east . \\n the result was a sluggish pond which attracted flotsam as it floated by , to be deposited on the shingle shore . \\n there was much other debris on the beach beside the raptor , including the boat which bolt and hoover had been using . \\n both craft were ashore and leaning slightly to one side , the propellers of their outboards , still in the water , as though they had been abandoned in haste . \\n the brothers were unlikely to be presented with a similar opportunity again . \\n the choice was simple : caution or daring . \\n either they could conceal themselves amongst the bushes of the good ship hope , lie low and bank on being swept back into the main stream ; or ... `` there 's no one here , '' harry whispered . \\n he imagined what had happened . \\n `` the rev got caught , finally . \\n perhaps he got swept ashore . \\n whatever . \\n he 's run off into the jungle and bolt 's gone after him . '' \\n `` nice of him to leave our boat , '' will commented . \\n `` that 'll make things easier from here on . \\n easier to steer than an island . '' \\n as the island encountered the gently shelving ground , it shuddered to a halt ten metres from the shore . \\n despite the toothy residents of the ezel , harry and will threw themselves headlong into the water , emerging in the shallows to wade ashore . \\n the raptor looked as though it had survived its trip with its temporary owner though , on closer inspection , will noticed the addition of a couple of small neat holes in the hull , each about a centimetre across and some similar ones in the superstructure . \\n bolt 's aim had been improving . \\n there was no time to make a more detailed examination . \\n both boys leant their weight against the raptor , heaving it off the beach and back into the water . \\n both experienced a curious and deeply unpleasant sensation as their backs were to the forest . \\n unbidden , the idea of a man peering down a telescopic sight with the crosshairs centred on the middle of his back , entered each boy 's head . \\n it lent them strength and haste , however , and the raptor floated away from the bank . \\n harry stepped in as will gave the stern a shove . \\n `` do n't start her up , yet , '' he instructed . \\n `` i 'll be a minute . '' \\n he turned his attention to the second boat . \\n it was a good deal faster than the raptor with a larger outboard . \\n will 's plan was simple . \\n bolt or hoover had foolishly left the keys . \\n he 'd chuck them into the ezel . \\n that would do it . \\n and he nearly had time to do just that . \\n nearly , but not quite . \\n as he reached for the keys which hung invitingly from the ignition , there was a shout of anger from the trees . \\n as will swung round , harry barked a warning and the metallic double click of a rifle bolt chambering a round echoed across the lagoon . \\n `` duck ! '' \\n shouted harry . \\n the bullet missed will by a few centimetres . \\n he turned and fled , dropping the keys into the bottom of the boat . \\n he sprinted into the shallows and launched himself into a flat running dive . \\n a frantic crawl brought him to the side of the raptor where his brother was desperately trying to start the outboard . \\n will flopped over the side as the motor burst into life . \\n harry flung himself at the controls , opening the throttle and slamming the wheel hard right . \\n the boat , already in the current , responded gamely and raised its nose as the propeller dug into the river . \\n the boys kept low . \\n and it was just as well they did . \\n they could not hear the reports from the rifles which bolt and hoover levelled at them from the bank : the roar of the mercury , protesting at the demands made on it , drowned them out . \\n however , the bullets , travelling at high velocity punched through the air above their heads breaking the sound barrier with a whip crack . \\n the perspex windshield over the steering wheel suddenly shattered as a shot clipped it . \\n another bullet thumped into the stern , narrowly missing the plastic housing of the outboard . \\n harry whipped the wheel left and right to put the marksmen off their aim . \\n suddenly , they were out in the river again . \\n the spur of land would soon give them desperately needed cover . \\n will risked a look back . \\n bolt was still trying to get an accurate range on them but loosed off no more shots . \\n hoover was trying to drag the other boat to the water singlehandedly . \\n as will watched , bolt joined him . \\n it would not be long before the race was on again . \\n harry did n't need instructions . \\n he was standing now and trying to wring as much speed as he could from the raptor . \\n for what seemed like an age , the boat leapt from wavelet to wavelet down the widening ezel and then , relief flooded over the boys as the river poured into lake brokopondo . \\n the thought that the end of their flight was within reach , gave them new hope . \\n but only for a short while . \\n there was still no sign of pursuit but neither boy thought that bolt would give up now . \\n and there was still a long way to go before they reached the safety and protection of civilisation at the other end of the lake . \\n they had one more life or death decision to make . \\n `` head over there , '' will shouted , indicating his right -- the east side of the lake . \\n `` we 'll get amongst the islands . \\n it 'll make it more difficult for them to find us . '' \\n the east of the valley which now held the lake had been the more mountainous part of the region before it had been inundated with water . \\n the tops of those hills and mountains still poked through the lake 's surface creating a maze of islands . \\n will hoped to be able to navigate their way north , slipping in and out of cover . \\n they should only have to travel the final few kilometres in the open . \\n *** it was perhaps just as well that the greene brothers were not around to witness the burning fury of adolphus bolt as he realised his quarry had eluded him again . \\n his rage was compounded by the fact that he could not work out how will and harry had appeared on the beach to reclaim their boat . \\n of course , after a time following the raptor , he had realised that they were not aboard . \\n he had reasoned that he could return for them , in the unlikely event that they survived the jungle . \\n in the meantime , having recognised the figure in the boat ahead of him as the fat american who had been snooping around his mine , he had resolved to finish that piece of business . \\n inexplicably , just when the american had allowed the raptor to become trapped in the river lagoon and bolt felt the kill , bolt had lost the scent again . \\n the american had disappeared in panic up the beach and had been enveloped by the forest . \\n bolt had strode after him , a round in the chamber , with no thought of playing with him this time . \\n one clean shot was all he 'd need . \\n hoover followed at a distance . \\n however , despite a lengthy search , and against all expectations , the american had vanished . \\n bolt 's instincts had sent him one way then another . \\n but they let him down . \\n then , he heard a distinct cough . \\n he brought the rifle up to his shoulder as he span round to face in the direction of the noise . \\n he carefully moved forward , using his knees to part the undergrowth . \\n `` where are you , yank ? '' \\n he called softly . \\n `` there is no way out . \\n show yourself . '' \\n squinting down the telescopic sight , he failed to see the very slight movement to his left . \\n a shape rose from the forest floor very slowly . \\n when he reached a half crouch , mw stopped and tried to steady his outstretched arms . \\n he pointed the walther at the approaching bolt and squeezed the trigger . \\n when out hunting , whether in the veldt in south africa , in the mountains of north america or the forests of germany , adolphus bolt had always felt a sense of supreme confidence in his ability to take down whatever he stalked . \\n bull elephant , grizzly bear or wild boar , he 'd got them all , trophies from different parts of the globe . \\n but they all had one thing in common : they never shot back . \\n this was a new experience for bolt . \\n suddenly , the air around his head was filled with the snap and crack of bullets whipping past . \\n leaves and twigs fell from the trees . \\n bolt turned and fled , nearly knocking hoover over as he went . \\n he only just kept the presence of mind to hang on to his rifle . \\n hoover gathered his wits , turned , and followed bolt back to the lagoon . \\n mw poked his head out from behind a tree and was delighted to see his tormentors ' backsides . \\n he popped off a couple of extra shots just to encourage them . \\n the frantic hunters leapt and ran through the forest , one behind the other , until they were forced to stop so they could breathe properly . \\n standing doubled up , bolt kept a wary eye on the jungle from which he had come , ready to take off again if the need arose . \\n hoover sucked in air , next to him . \\n there was no sound from the trees . \\n it took the two men fully five minutes to recover from their shock . \\n bolt needed something to bolster his self-esteem . \\n he shouted at the jungle : `` you come out , yank , you 're dead . \\n you ' ear what i 'm saying ? \\n you better be planning on staying in there to rot , man . '' \\n a voice drifted to the men from the direction of the lagoon : `` do n't start her up , yet . '' \\n for ten seconds , bolt and hoover stared at each other , as if neither could believe his ears . \\n bolt reacted first . \\n `` it 's those bloody kids ! \\n c\\u2019mon ! '' \\n he set off towards the river . \\n he was utterly furious when he reached the beach . \\n by the time he had emptied a magazine after the fleeing brothers , his temper was at such a pitch that hoover was beginning to fear for his own safety with the general manager . \\n fired by anger and forgetting about mw , bolt had dragged the boat to the water , cursing hoover for a weakling . \\n he had screamed at hoover to get after the brothers and had flung his rifle to the ground in frustration when it became clear that the ignition keys were missing . \\n eventually , of course , he had calmed down . \\n he had addressed the situation rationally and had set to work stripping the outboard with a view to starting it without the keys . \\n as he worked , he told hoover that the advantage remained with them . \\n but he emphasised that the boys could not be allowed to leave the jungle . \\n if that happened , their whole business would be finished . \\n then there was the little matter of importing child labour from brazil ... bolt knew the ezel ; he knew lake brokopondo . \\n in a straight race from one end of the lake to the other , their boat would outstrip the raptor with ease . \\n all he needed was a clean shot . \\n if he could get close enough to hit the fuel tank of the outboard ... kaboom ! \\n end of boat , end of boys , all disposed of in deep water . \\n hoover hovered and nodded in agreement . \\n when he accidentally stood on the keys , he discreetly kicked them under the edge of the gunwale . \\n no point in aggravating the man further . \\n the motor had finally yielded to bolt 's efforts and turned over . \\n they were an hour , at most , behind the fleeing greenes . \\n they knew where the boys were heading . \\n bolt nodded to hoover and the australian flipped the wheel of the boat and steered it downstream towards the lake . \\n chapter twenty-five forty kilometres , flitting from island to island , constantly peering behind expecting to see death chasing them . \\n four hours of hide and seek . \\n hide for your life ; death , the seeker . \\n from time to time , they took the extra precaution of silencing the outboard to listen for signs of trouble . \\n apart from the light across the water , however , they appeared to be alone and safe . \\n occasionally , way out to the west , they sighted the commercial traffic which they had seen from the helicopter when they had first arrived in the jungle . \\n there were bauxite barges and the great river tugs dragging impossibly large teardrops of timber . \\n all too far away to help -- ten and more kilometres across the lake ; had will and harry made a break for it , they would have left themselves horribly exposed . \\n better to make the short trips from cover to cover . \\n they glimpsed the great dam from several kilometres out , between the islands , but resisted the temptation to open the taps and race across open water . \\n will had some difficulty restraining harry whose patience was being stretched . \\n finally , they nestled beside the most northerly island . \\n it was large and heavily wooded and only about two kilometres away from the great wall that rose from the water . \\n as the raptor idled , the boys could plainly see a dock surrounded by a collection of huts and more permanent buildings . \\n against the skyline , the silhouettes of cranes and gantries stood starkly in the afternoon sun . \\n one or two boats moved busily around the foot of the dam . \\n once they got there , they would surely be safe . \\n it was a facility for the workers that maintained and serviced the huge barrier that held back the lake . \\n and will knew that there was a police outpost on the site . \\n the raptor would take little more than five minutes to cross the distance . \\n even if bolt spotted them , once they were underway , it would be too risky for him to follow them . \\n they 'd made it ! \\n he killed the motor one last time and listened for any sound of approaching danger . \\n just the sighing of the breeze in the leaves of the trees . \\n `` check the tank , harry . '' \\n running out of fuel now would be a bit of a blunder after all their exertions . \\n standing beside the outboard , harry glanced down at the gauge . \\n `` we 're fine . '' \\n will pressed the starter . \\n the outboard turned over once . \\n he hit start again and the mercury coughed into life . \\n `` ready ? '' \\n will called over his shoulder as he eased open the throttle and nosed the raptor from the overhanging cover and out from the lee of the island . \\n neither boy saw the abrupt arrival of bolt and hoover . \\n their boat nosed sleekly round the edge of the island and closed the gap rapidly . \\n will turned just in time to register bolt 's triumphant grin as he deliberately steered into the raptor , hitting it on the port bow . \\n it was not a tremendously heavy blow -- some scraped paint ; maybe a small dent -- but it was enough to spin the raptor on its axis . \\n will staggered and went down on one knee . \\n harry , completely unprepared for the jolt , was pitched over the side into the water , his startled yell alerting his brother . \\n `` get away , harry ! \\n it 's bolt ! '' \\n shielded from the general manager 's sight by the raptor 's hull , harry upended and swam down into the murky water . \\n will 's last sight of his brother was his kicking basketball boots . \\n a shout from bolt and will spun round . \\n bolt 's rifle was pointing down into the raptor . \\n bolt pulled the trigger . \\n will fell to the boat 's floor , not quite believing what was happening . \\n another shot . \\n and another . \\n a spout of water was kicked up by each of the shots . \\n `` come on , man ! \\n two guns have a better chance of getting him than one . '' \\n bolt had paused to admonish hoover and will realised that he had been shooting just over the raptor into the lake where he estimated harry to be . \\n he stopped worrying about the holes that bolt 's bullets would make in his body ; but began to be very frightened for his brother . \\n his shouts for the men to stop were ignored as bolt emptied another magazine into the lake . \\n hoover was less enthusiastic , it seemed , firing wide and long . \\n a sudden silence fell across the water . \\n bolt peered at the surface , scrutinising every ripple . \\n `` anything ? '' \\n he muttered . \\n hoover shook his head . \\n both men automatically reloaded as they scanned the water . \\n `` how far you think he could swim ? '' \\n hoover pointed . \\n `` out there ? \\n forty , fifty metres ? \\n not much more . '' \\n they stood staring expectantly . \\n twice bolt consulted his watch . \\n will crouched in the raptor , stealing a look for his brother between watching where bolt 's rifle pointed . \\n at last bolt seemed satisfied . \\n he spat into the lake . \\n `` a shame . \\n i would have preferred to see the body or at least some blood in the water . '' \\n he turned his attention to will , lazily covering him with his rifle . \\n `` you took your time , boy . '' \\n he had a smirk on his face as he glanced at hoover . \\n `` told you : clever lads . \\n knew we 'd catch them on the open lake . '' \\n he turned back to will . \\n `` sneaked up among the islands , eh ? \\n we had plenty of time to get here . \\n this is the logical place for you to come -- the last island . \\n do n't be disappointed , boy . \\n you did well . \\n but i am a hunter ; a good hunter . \\n and a good hunter reads his prey . '' \\n will spoke for the first time : `` you ca n't do anything . \\n we 're not in the jungle anymore . \\n look -- there are people over there . '' \\n there was a touch of desperation in will 's voice . \\n deep down , he knew that busy men two kilometres away would not see them . \\n at best , they 'd see two boats -- tiny dots -- on the horizon and give them not a second thought . \\n `` if you think i would let you go now , you 're not as clever as i thought you were , '' bolt said , his face darkening . \\n `` your demise will take place a little nearer civilisation than i had planned , but make no mistake : we are still in the jungle . \\n after you are '' -- he chose the phrase carefully -- `` disposed of , we will tow your boat a little way further out and put a hole in it . \\n `` but you 're right : no need to draw undue attention to ourselves . '' \\n he spoke again to hoover . \\n `` shove their boat round the corner , away from prying eyes . '' \\n as hoover revved the engine of the larger boat , will could do nothing but wait . \\n bolt was taking no chances : he kept his gun trained on the boy . \\n carefully , hoover began to push the raptor through the water , side on . \\n will realised that he was manoeuvring both craft around the shore of the island . \\n twenty metres or so and they would both be out of sight of the dam . \\n any hope of outside intervention would be lost . \\n briefly , he considered diving beneath the raptor 's superstructure and opening the throttle all the way . \\n it would be a slim chance at best . \\n bolt seemed to read his mind . \\n `` kill the motor , boy , '' he said . \\n and , when will did not move : `` now , or i put a slug in your leg . '' \\n he took aim . \\n will cut the motor . \\n his mouth was dry with fear . \\n but he would not go without a final effort . \\n he appealed to hoover . \\n `` you want to be a murderer ? \\n you can stop this . \\n you know it 's wrong . '' \\n hoover remained impassive . \\n `` it 's nothin ' personal , lad . \\n we got business interests to protect . '' \\n but he could not bring himself to look at will directly . \\n `` how do you expect to get away with it ? '' \\n will asked , in desperation . \\n as bolt answered , he chambered a round and lifted the stock of his rifle to his shoulder . \\n `` imagine the task of trying to find two bodies in a lake which covers one and a half thousand square kilometres . \\n a lake which is , in places , over a hundred metres deep . \\n difficult . \\n and what if you do n't even know the bodies are there ? '' \\n will watched as his view of the dam disappeared round the edge of the island . \\n `` a little bit further , '' muttered bolt . \\n hoover complied . \\n the shore of the island rose steeply from the water here about ten metres from the boats . \\n it would be easily swimmable for will , but there was nowhere for him to scramble out of the lake even if he got to land without being shot . \\n his major regret was that his father would never know what had happened . \\n `` like mr hoover said , it 's nothing personal , '' said bolt . \\n he closed his left eye as he sighted down the scope on his rifle , tilting his head to the right . \\n will closed his eyes . \\n the crash , when it came , was not what the boy was expecting . \\n *** if will had not shouted his warning to harry when the younger boy had been tossed into the lake , harry would have been standing next to his brother in the raptor as the bolt took aim . \\n having fallen in , he would have dragged himself back over the side of the boat under bolt 's gaze . \\n any attempt at flight then would have been futile . \\n in the event , he realised that he was temporarily invisible . \\n he knew that the general manager would take no more chances this close to safety ; that he would shoot first and deal with the consequences later . \\n this was confirmed when the first bullets fizzed past his head as he sought the safety of deep water . \\n their supersonic velocity was lessened as they entered the lake , though they would still have taken a chunk out of him had he not been lucky . \\n but luck played only a part in harry 's escape . \\n he was smart enough to recognise the pointlessness of swimming out into the lake . \\n eventually , he would have to come up for air . \\n then , he would be target practice for bolt and hoover . \\n it was instinct that led him to twist around and swim beneath the hull of the raptor , and he quickly grasped the sense of striking out for the shore . \\n the hill top that had become the island when the lake was formed , must have been a steep one : the water was deep until very close to the land . \\n there , the tangled roots of mangroves formed a cage above and below the lake surface . \\n he wriggled between two stout roots , still underwater , his lungs starting to protest . \\n cautiously , he eased his head from the water , managing to breathe quietly . \\n he peered between the roots , which were like the bars of some organic prison . \\n in the shade , he knew he could not be seen from the two boats which floated a few metres away . \\n the crack of shots reached his ears ; he could see bolt and hoover , their backs bent to the butts of their rifle stocks , as they fired . \\n he shuddered . \\n quietly , he hauled himself up through the root system , while the men were distracted . \\n he slipped into the undergrowth and watched with some dread what was happening . \\n he saw the two men looking for his bullet-riddled body ; watched as bolt spat ; he strained to hear what was being said , but was too far from the boats . \\n panic gripped him . \\n the last thing he wanted to see was his brother 's murder . \\n but it looked like he was getting a front seat . \\n the thought that bolt seemed to think he was already dead was scant consolation . \\n hoover brought his boat round and began to push the raptor through the water . \\n to begin with , harry did not understand why . \\n he thought bolt would just put a bullet in will there and then . \\n impotently , he followed the progress of the two boats , scrabbling over and under the lush forest which covered the island . \\n still , he could not hear what passed between bolt and will . \\n as he moved , the ground began to slope upwards . \\n he climbed and found himself a little ahead of the boats at the top of an escarpment . \\n he left the mangroves , which preferred the water , behind . \\n the top of the small bluff on which he found himself was home to a stand of brazil nut trees , not that harry would have known even if he were not frantic with worry for his brother 's predicament . \\n what he did notice was the band of honey coloured gills around the base of one of the great trees . \\n watching the slow progress of the two boats , the inkling of a plan sprang into his mind . \\n he crawled close to the tree and broke a piece of the fungus which had infected it away from the trunk . \\n the wood beneath it was dry and flaky , just like that of the tree that will had pushed over to win his bet at the apetina . \\n honey fungus . \\n he poked at the wood . \\n the tree was riddled -- rotten to its core . \\n the brazil was a whole lot bigger than the one will had shoved into the ezel . \\n its narrow bare trunk stretched up into the sky where , maybe thirty metres up , its leafy branches sprouted like a giant green balloon on a string . \\n up there would be the nuts for which the trees are so prized . \\n but harry was not interested in the fruit . \\n he thought briefly that his plan may be nuts , but he had no alternative ideas . \\n without thinking further , he selected a second tree , which stood three feet away from the rotten specimen . \\n he positioned his body between the two trunks and began to wriggle his way upwards , keeping an eye on the scene on the lake . \\n it all depended on just how far the rot had eaten away at the tree 's core-wood ; that and how far he could climb . \\n he watched with mounting horror as bolt aimed his rifle at will . \\n there was not enough time : the boats had to be closer for his plan to have any chance of success . \\n he suddenly realised that if he misjudged the distances , bolt would be alerted to the fact that he was still alive . \\n that gave him pause . \\n could he dare risk it ? \\n he put the thought from his mind . \\n it was now or never if he did n't want to be an only child . \\n he was ten metres up and the boats were almost level with him , about ten metres off-shore . \\n he braced himself between the two trunks , shoulders on the healthy tree , feet against the trunk of the rotten one . \\n he heaved , straining to crack the fibres that were still holding the brazil upright . \\n for thirty seconds there was no give at all . \\n was he wasting his time ? \\n had the parasite not had time to eat its way right through the wood ? \\n he strained , once more , using all his might . \\n just as his strength began to ebb from his taut limbs , he felt a slight movement . \\n he bunched his muscles for one last effort . \\n there was no sound as the trunk sheared off near its base : the rotten wood was too pulpy for it to part with a crack . \\n instead , the tree silently healed over , toppling over the water . \\n as harry fell , his support gone , he thought he had misjudged his timing . \\n the great tree trunk was going to hit the raptor . \\n will would not see it coming . \\n he would be crushed . \\n the loamy ground cushioned the boy 's fall and he rolled quickly and with some trepidation to see the outcome of his action . \\n as though in slow motion , the great brazil arced through the air . \\n as it did so , hoover gunned his motor to shove the raptor further along . \\n the result was a direct hit on bolt and hoover 's boat . \\n the narrow trunk missed both men but smashed down with an enormous crash , pulverising the boat 's stern . \\n neither bolt nor hoover had seen a thing . \\n both were taken completely unawares . \\n with cries of alarm , they were both catapulted into the lake like dolls . \\n harry watched as will , shocked by what for him had been a narrow escape , shied away from the crunch and splash caused by the falling tree . \\n the impact pushed the raptor away from the wreckage , towards the escarpment . \\n will looked around wild-eyed to try to make sense of what had just happened . \\n he was astonished to see his younger brother , resurrected from the depths of the lake , now standing on the bluff , waving . \\n `` you all right , will ? '' \\n harry called . \\n the practical side of will 's mind took over . \\n this was their chance . \\n `` get in the boat , '' he yelled . \\n harry did not need a second invitation . \\n he took a running leap from the rock and , arms flailing , plunged into the water . \\n when he reached the raptor , his brother was only too happy to haul him on board . \\n the reaction to his close shave with death left will cold and shaking , but he had the good grace to thank his brother . \\n `` whatever you did , '' he said , `` it was tree-medous . '' \\n he hit the starter and , with no thought for the two men struggling to get to shore , he turned the raptor for the safety of the brokopondo dam . \\n chapter twenty-six having eaten infrequently over the last couple of days , the boys took full advantage of the stuyvesant 's kitchens . \\n the chef did n't let them down . \\n they tucked into pan-fried plantain with ginger and sugar , cold meats and warm rolls , spiced with mustard sambal , and mountains of fresh fruit . \\n it was 9 o\\u2019clock in the morning and the sun shone warmly on the hotel 's terrace restaurant . \\n three greenes and mac were finishing a long breakfast , seated beside the pool . \\n alan greene 's left leg was encased in plaster from the thigh to the ankle and supported by a frame that projected from his wheel chair which had been pushed up to the table . \\n other than that , he looked remarkably fit and relaxed . \\n he had spent 48 hours in paramaribo university hospital undergoing tests after having had the fracture set . \\n if he had worried about his sons in the jungle , he had not shown it . \\n they were sensible , capable lads . \\n when they had finally reached the brokopondo dam the previous afternoon , the boys ' first concern had been for the children that bolt and his little gang were working in the jungle . \\n when details had been passed to paramaribo , lucas perk , the police inspector , had taken charge . \\n within the hour , he had flown in from parbo in the police helicopter , an aw101 -- a reassuringly robust aircraft -- with a team of officers . \\n bruce mcintyre touched down shortly afterwards with mary-lou harper at the controls of the sikorsky . \\n at will 's insistence , both machines headed out across the jungle to free the children at the gold mine , while a boat was dispatched to deal with bolt and hoover . \\n will had been astonished at how quickly they had covered the ground that had taken him and harry a day and half to travel . \\n just two hours later , the two helos lifted off from the clearing in the forest . \\n there were eleven brazilian children on board , together with the three guards , cuffed and under the supervision of two of policemen . \\n they were also in charge of a number of cases of `` tin '' soldiers . \\n the look on constan\\u00e7a 's face -- on all the children 's faces -- had been extraordinary as will had stepped from the sikorsky and walked into the camp through the clouds of dust thrown up by the choppers ' dramatic arrival . \\n there had been no resistance from the guards , such was their surprise . \\n before they parted at zorg en hoop airstrip when they had flown into paramaribo , constan\\u00e7a had reached up to place a second kiss on will 's cheek . \\n `` sank you , weel , '' she had said simply , before boarding a specially chartered flight to rio . \\n at will 's insistence , alan greene had made arrangements for each of the children to be suitably compensated for their ordeal and their time in the jungle . \\n while they sat finishing their meal , lucas perk , emerged from the hotel and approached the table . \\n he removed his peaked cap and greeted the diners . \\n alan greene immediately asked him to join them . \\n he sat and accepted a cup of coffee , before beginning to apologise effusively for the trouble that the greenes had been put to . \\n alan greene brushed the apology aside . \\n they had known , he said , that the jungle held various dangers -lrb- not necessarily those they 'd encountered -rrb- and that had they wanted a quiet life , they would have remained in england . \\n the policeman nodded his acceptance of greene 's attitude . \\n he went on to tell them that bolt and hoover were to be charged with attempted murder . \\n there were other charges of kidnapping and enslavement , not to mention various counts of fraud and deception , which the authorities were still considering . \\n a dormant case had been reopened when the circumstances surrounding bolt 's activities had come to light . \\n it was a case concerning a certain eminent british professor who had been gunned down while on expedition in the jungle about a year ago . \\n there was good evidence to suggest that bolt may have had something to do with that . \\n as for the good reverend -- inspector perk rolled his eyes , here -- officers had been despatched up river to seek him , dead or alive . \\n perk told them of the real identity of the reverend . \\n a call to the fbi with harry and will 's description suggested that the reverend dwayne dillinger , aka mike wilkinson , was well-known to the american authorities and that they would very much like to get reacquainted with him ; there was the matter of the death of a texan correctional officer , amongst other things . \\n alan greene had weighed harry 's evidence , his suspicions and warnings of the bearded man . \\n he had listened harry 's account of mw 's parting taunt . \\n all things considered , he thought the chances of the man ever troubling them again were remote ; he certainly did n't want to instil paranoia in his sons . \\n secretly , greene hardly expected mw to emerge from the jungle ; and even if he did , the us authorities would be holding him for many years to come . \\n they 'd never see the man again . \\n when the inspector had gone , alan greene congratulated his sons again on the way in which they had completed their task . \\n mac chipped in with words of praise . \\n both will and harry felt proud of what they had accomplished . \\n both had the same thought on their minds : what next ? \\n at the same time , they were aware that plans would have to go on hold , probably for the rest of the summer . \\n that thought left them a little deflated after the excitement of the last few days . \\n *** at midday , they bid farewell to mary-lou , who had kindly flown them to zanderij international , and trooped across the apron towards the boeing . \\n the engines were already idling , adding to the heat haze which shimmered off the tarmac . \\n three hundred metres away stood a mcdonnell douglas 82 , decked out in the yellow , orange and red livery of suriname airways . \\n it strained against its brakes as the twin engines developed the power to launch it down the runway . \\n it was destined for trinidad and tobago . \\n from his window seat , a stocky , bald man with a heavy moustache , regarded the two boys , and the man pushing a wheel chair , as they approached their aircraft . \\n mw smiled grimly to himself . \\n it had taken him all of fourteen hours to get out of suriname . \\n he had really thought he 'd had it when bolt had followed him into the jungle . \\n he had been shaking badly when he 'd resorted to the walther and he 'd loosed off a whole magazine . \\n fortunately , it seemed that bolt and his sidekick had no stomach for a fair fight . \\n cautiously , mw had followed them back to the river and watched as they took pot shots at the greene brothers . \\n he 'd witnessed bolt 's rage and sat impatiently as bolt worked on the motor . \\n when bolt and hoover finally set off down river , mw had set himself on the spur of land that stuck out into the ezel , hoping that someone -- anyone -- would come by . \\n he knew that the great mineral barges used the river and banked on getting picked up . \\n waving a shirt and shouting are crude signalling techniques , however , they worked for mw . \\n after only an hour or so , one of the great hulks heaved to . \\n a skiff was launched and mw was taken aboard . \\n in style true to form , mw span a yarn about having been abandoned by his expedition leader , about daring escapes from the wilder animals of the forest -- `` my marine training saw me through , y ' hear '' -- and his astonishing march across countless kilometres of hostile country . \\n he was looked after , fed and regarded with awe . \\n delivered to paramaribo , he declined the captain 's offer to inform the authorities of his plight and disappeared into the town . \\n early the next morning , very early , a tall well-built man , with a bald head and a heavy moustache , stepped out of mw 's hotel and hailed a taxi . \\n later , the hotel chambermaid would discover a quantity of hair in the waste basket in mw 's room , shake her head at the never ending variety of behaviour exhibited by foreign tourists , and empty it into her trolley . \\n the authorities had a photograph of mw -- a full head of hair and heavy beard -- at the departure gate of zanderij airport . \\n they did not bat an eyelid when the bald man presented his passport for the scheduled flight to trinidad and tobago . \\n why should they ? \\n his passport declared he was a lawyer from orlando by the name of obadiah calleston . \\n as he settled back in his window seat , mw allowed himself another smile . \\n in his hip pocket nestled the bottle which contained the precious fungus : his future in a small plastic tube . \\n he imagined he would sell it for several tens of millions of dollars . \\n that would make the fee from stone look like chicken feed . \\n nice to have it , though . \\n *** halfway across the atlantic ocean , that evening , while his sons slept off the rigours of the last week , alan greene was concluding the deal he had set out to make . \\n zmi had agreed to the merger , pleased that they would not be bearing the cost of returning the forest to its original state alone . \\n the projected profits -lrb- while lower than those that greenestone would have settled for a couple of years ago -rrb- more than satisfied greene . \\n mining with a conscience , was how he thought of it . \\n and , in the light of the `` hindrances to your visit '' , as they had put it , the surinamese government had offered greene the chance to take over and develop the gold mine that bolt had stumbled upon . \\n the only stipulation was that he apply the same green criteria to that operation as he was bringing to the apetina mine . \\n `` greene criteria , minister , '' he had said with a smile in his voice over the phone to paramaribo 's interior ministry . \\n aluminium and gold . \\n a good week 's work . \\n and any damage done to the rainforest would be repaired when the mining was done . \\n *** though it was shaping up to be a hot summer in england , compared to the equatorial heat of paramaribo , bristol was cool . \\n the day after they arrived back from suriname , the greene 's had a duty to perform . \\n one thing they had tried to do in the surinamese jungle , had eluded them . \\n thanks to the man they now knew as michael wilkinson , they were on their way to the university of bristol to see professor ramsundar , empty handed . \\n harry had found and then lost the fungus that he had asked them to locate . \\n they were highly conscious of the disappointment that awaited the professor . \\n it was almost crueller to tell him that they had found a sample , gathered it and then lost it , than to tell him they had not come across it at all . \\n the professor received them in his office , an air of expectation which he was unable to conceal , on his face . \\n greene senior , realising that this was the sort of news that should be delivered without misplaced prevarication , came straight out with it . \\n `` professor . \\n look , i 'm sorry , but we failed you . '' \\n ramsundar 's face hardly moved , but it was clear he had pinned serious hopes on the greenes ' expedition . \\n when , after all , would he have the chance to ask anyone else ? \\n someone who might just be going to suriname ; might just be planning a trip up an uncharted tributary of a little-known river in the least known country in south america ? \\n until he had proof of his theory of the fungus ' properties , no one was going to fund another expedition to the other side of the world on the off chance that they might find another sample . \\n `` no sign ? '' \\n he asked . \\n `` it was never going to be easy . '' \\n `` no , we found it , '' blurted out harry . \\n `` i got a sample . \\n then i lost it . '' \\n his face fell . \\n `` what ? '' \\n the professor , exclaimed . \\n will spoke . \\n `` professor , the fungus definitely exists ... '' `` i know that , '' snapped ramsundar , a flash of impatience in his eyes . \\n `` ... i mean , we found it . \\n harry found it . \\n he got some , the same as the one in your pictures . \\n but ... '' he trailed off here `` ... we lost it . '' \\n for a moment , the professor looked as though he might explode . \\n he gripped the armrests of his wheel chair , the pressure making his arms tremble . \\n alan greene stepped in -- or , rather , rolled in . \\n he was still in a wheel chair . \\n now he wheeled himself right up to the professor 's desk . \\n `` professor , there 's nothing that can be done now . \\n harry located a small sample of the fungus and collected it . \\n unknown to anyone , there was some madman in the jungle who , for some reason , decided to mug -- for want of a better word -- my sons . \\n he stole , not only the sample , but their boat . \\n a sort of high-waterway robbery . \\n crime 's on the up , you know . '' \\n the professor seemed to calm down . \\n `` i am sorry . \\n you did your best . '' \\n he made an effort to compose himself , taking a deep breath and unnecessarily shuffling a sheaf of papers on his desk . \\n he asked harry to recount in as much detail as possible the circumstances of the find . \\n harry gave the professor all the information he could recall . \\n and then , the disappointed professor turned once more to alan greene . \\n `` one day , mr greene , i will be able to start work on the fungus . \\n that day is not yet here . \\n gentlemen -- all three -- i must bid you farewell . \\n i 'm sure you are busy and i have much to do . '' \\n with that , the professor reached for his keyboard . \\n the greenes exchanged glances and turned to leave the room . \\n suddenly , ramsundar barked a command : `` stop ! '' \\n greene and the two boys stopped , turned and peered at the professor with some curiosity . \\n he was leaning forward in his chair and appeared to be sniffing the air . \\n his eyes glinted with excitement . \\n `` what , '' he asked , `` is that smell ? '' \\n no one answered . \\n they stood -lrb- or sat -rrb- in confusion . \\n `` there . '' \\n the professor 's head bobbed as he breathed deeply through his nose , like an excited labrador . \\n he inhaled once more . \\n `` sharp , pungent , bleach ... '' he seemed to be ticking off a checklist . \\n `` harry 's feet , '' muttered will . \\n `` what ? '' \\n will had made the flippant comment quietly , not to be overheard by the professor . \\n he reddened slightly , but answered . \\n `` my brother 's feet can be a bit stinky ... i 'm sorry . \\n it was a joke . '' \\n `` indeed . '' \\n ramsundar leaned forward as far as he was able and peered at harry 's feet . \\n `` young man , '' he said , `` take off your shoes . '' \\n confusion sprang to harry 's face . \\n `` w-what ? '' \\n `` your shoes -- take them off , '' the professor demanded . \\n he bumped his desk in his haste to wheel himself out from behind it . \\n `` come on , come on ! '' \\n alan greene merely shrugged and nodded in answer to his younger son 's puzzled look . \\n still hesitant , harry squatted and unlaced his basketball boots . \\n sadly , they were looking rather the worse for wear . \\n despite their still garish colours , the tropical heat and the water from the ezel had done them no good . \\n eagerly , the professor reached for the first one to come off and , to his guests ' surprise , brought it up to his nose and sniffed it as he might a fine wine . \\n a joyful smile spread across his face . \\n he took the second boot and repeated the ritual : the smile grew wider . \\n `` mission accomplished , '' he said slowly , without taking the footwear away from his face . \\n `` i am more grateful than i can tell you . '' \\n ramsundar abruptly realised that what he was doing might seem a little odd to onlookers -lrb- the bemusement of the greenes was plain -rrb- . \\n `` young man , '' he said , addressing harry . \\n `` you say you lost the sample of my precious fungus . \\n you say you were mugged for it . \\n but you have , without knowing it , delivered exactly what i wanted . '' \\n he held a shoe in front of him as if were a sacred object . \\n this did nothing to dispel the puzzlement of alan greene and his sons . \\n `` miraculum percuro ramsundar may have been difficult to find , difficult to hold on to , but it has held on to you . \\n you must have trodden in an area fertile with spores . \\n they impregnated the canvass of your boots -- and thrived in the warm , dark , moist environment . \\n funguses are talented survivors ; they will thrive almost anywhere . \\n gentlemen , '' he concluded , dramatically , `` these shoes contain enough fungus for me to cultivate all the per ram i need . \\n within a week , i will begin work in earnest . '' \\n `` you 're telling us that some living organism , other than my brother , has survived in his shoes ? '' \\n will asked . \\n `` precisely . \\n precisely , '' said the happy professor . \\n `` they 're not that bad , '' harry complained . \\n but the looks on his brother and father 's faces said otherwise . \\n `` so , '' greene began , tentatively , `` the particular environment that exists in my son 's shoes -- sweat , bacteria , flakes of dead skin -- encouraged your fungus to take root and he brought it back without knowing it . '' \\n `` that is it in a nutshell -- or in a basketball boot . '' \\n the professor steepled his fingers -lrb- careful not to let the boots slip from his lap -rrb- and launched into a scientific explanation : `` you see , there are all the ingredients needed to propagate this particular species -- warmth , moisture , a good dose of ammonia ... '' *** in the car on the way home , harry was able , for the first time , to be less than defensive about his feet . \\n in fact , he felt he ought to get some credit for the portable propagators he seemed to be carrying around on the ends of his legs . \\n `` it was a sort of back-up , really , '' he claimed . \\n `` just in case of loss , you know ? '' \\n `` i 've never heard of boot biology , '' will commented . \\n `` there are advantages to having feet with active metabolism . '' \\n harry maintained . \\n `` the professor said so . '' \\n as the boys bickered good-naturedly in the back , mac drove smoothly back to clifton , while greene senior sat in the passenger seat , leg thrust out before him , with a very satisfied smile on his face . \\n he had allowed his boys -- no : his new business partners -- to go it alone and the results had been seriously impressive . \\n he had added a bauxite mine and a gold mine to his business interests ; and now , the professor 's predictions suggested that the potential of the fungus would provide at least one of his pharmaceutical companies with material to work with for years to come . \\n the financial projections were huge . \\n but , he reminded himself , the benefits that this work would give to countless individual human beings , would be priceless . \\n chapter twenty-seven jonas stone sat in his office , brooding . \\n he did a lot of brooding of late . \\n surrounding him were many of the trappings of his great wealth . \\n an observer would stare , open-mouthed , around the man 's work room . \\n the computer screens -lrb- three of them -rrb- were too large for the desk at which he sat , and stood ranged in front and to the sides on stands ; the strange but hypnotic emanual , sat ready in place of a conventional mouse . \\n there were a number of suspiciously recognisable works of art -- was that a picasso ? \\n -- hanging from the walls , protected by reinforced plexiglas . \\n fifty storeys below the office , in a compound which was protected night and day by at least two security personnel , stood the bugatti veyron pur sang which stone had driven in from his kensington home that morning . \\n this thoroughbred special edition of the world 's greatest hyper car was one of only five ever produced . \\n and beneath the edwardian mansion where stone lived , work had recently been completed on the excavation of a three storey vault . \\n stone had originally wanted to sink a shaft five storeys into the earth below london . \\n he 'd settled -lrb- for the time being -rrb- on permission to go down just twelve metres . \\n he needed to make room for his growing car collection which had to be displayed in an air-conditioned environment ; for his tennis court , which required a double height ceiling ; and for the leisure centre which had to make do with an olympic-sized swimming pool and a cinema with room to seat only forty guests . \\n and yet , despite all this , stone brooded . \\n with such deep pockets , jonas stone was used to getting exactly what he wanted . \\n when he wanted it . \\n that his instructions to mw had failed to produce the desired results irked him tremendously . \\n his ex-partner had come back from south america not only with the prize he had set out for , but also another lucrative mining concern . \\n and , added to that , a discovery from which medicines would be produced which would sell for ... well , stone knew the value of new pharmaceutical products . \\n stone had convinced himself that alan greene could not operate without him ; had sat back and waited for greene to fail . \\n he had even taken out a small insurance policy to ensure greene 's failure . \\n and it should have worked . \\n who in their right mind would leave their teenage sons in the jungle ? \\n who would expect a couple of english schoolboys to succeed in such spectacular style ? \\n business was not for them , surely . \\n it was for hard-nosed professionals , men who could make clear judgements and incisive decisions . \\n men like stone . \\n stone was beginning to perceive the activities of the greenes as a personal slight . \\n they were beginning to make him look bad . \\n he worried that people in business would laugh at him for refusing greene 's offer to join him on his environmental crusade . \\n greene could not be allowed to succeed . \\n the one thing jonas stone hated more than anything else was to be laughed at . \\n he looked again at the report from the times on one of the flat screens in front of him . \\n it was effusive about greene 's step into ethical business and it even mentioned his sons . \\n greene gauges success one of the county 's most successful businessmen , alan greene , has announced he has set up an ethically-driven enterprise which , he claims , will become the template for the way business is done in the future . \\n in a statement released yesterday , greene , detailed the success of the venture 's first outing in south america . \\n together with his sons -- both teenagers -- whom greene considers partners in the project , he has agreed a deal with the dutch mining concern , zmi , to extract bauxite from the surinamese rainforest in a more environmentally friendly manner . \\n `` this way of mining and returning the forest to its natural state , preserves one of the planet 's most vital ecosystems , '' greene said . \\n `` we know that there are resources across the globe which are being lost forever as industry scrambles for ever more profit without any thought for the future . '' \\n greene 's words were underscored by the discovery on the trip of a new kind of fungus which , it is believed , contains properties which may be significant in the development of a new neurological superdrug which offers hope for victims of paralysis . \\n scientists in bristol are working on it . \\n stone 's jealousy of greene had him in its grip . \\n somehow , he would regain the upper hand . \\n he brought a fist down on the edge of his desk and silently swore . \\n he reached over to the emanual and , with a few deft movements , opened one of his email accounts and began composing a missive to mw , wherever he might be . \\n he would almost certainly need the man 's help in future , if he were to bring the greenes down . \\n the greenes . \\n all three of them were now in his sights . \\n *** it was friday . \\n alan greene sat with harry and will in bright sunshine on the roof terrace of prospect house . \\n mrs emery , the housekeeper , had provided a light lunch for them and , as they ate , greene senior was looking to the future . \\n `` there has to be a real alternative or , more likely , several alternatives , to fossil fuels . \\n you know what they are ? '' \\n harry answered for both brothers : `` yeah , sure : oil , gas , coal . '' \\n `` just checking , '' greene grinned . \\n `` things like solar power , wind power , wave power . \\n all those things which are renewable . \\n what do you know of them ? '' \\n `` we saw the dam at brokopondo , '' will observed . \\n `` that was producing electricity . '' \\n `` hydro power , '' harry added . \\n `` hydro-electric power , '' greene concluded . \\n `` it had been my intention to have a good look at the operation at brokopondo . \\n we were going to check it out after looking at the apetina mine but , '' he tapped the plaster cast on his left leg , `` things got on top of me . \\n `` i 'm interested in any form of renewable energy now . \\n the fossil fuels have been an extraordinary source of power . \\n they helped create the modern world . \\n without them , we would n't have cars or planes , or factories with the necessary power to build them . \\n and that ... '' he pointed at the sleek beautiful bridge that carried a narrow roadway across the avon gorge `` ... that would n't have been built . \\n `` fossil fuels gave engineers like brunel the energy they needed to drive their ideas forwards . \\n but they have two fundamental flaws . '' \\n `` they 're going to run out , '' offered harry . \\n `` and they release carbon dioxide , the greenhouse gas , '' added will . \\n `` one of the greenhouse gases , '' greene agreed . \\n `` a lot of work has been going on over the last few years on different methods of producing energy in a clean , sustainable way . \\n i suggest the greenes have a look at what progress is being made . \\n different locations offer different solutions . \\n and there 's always going to be a demand for power . \\n `` you 'll remember the wind turbines in the hills south of granada and the fields of solar panels in california . \\n and just here , in the river severn , they are thinking of building a wave machine , to harness the rise and fall of the tidal estuary . '' \\n greene 's sons nodded . \\n two years earlier they had trekked through the high alpujarras in southern spain and been hypnotically drawn to the great sleek white machines whose slender blades turned slowly in the wind . \\n they had put will in mind of one footed aliens ; they had an other-worldliness . \\n several times they had visited the golden state , california , and the sight of thousands of silver panels in straight rows , gathering the sun 's rays , was a familiar one . \\n both the wind-turbines and the fields of photovotaic cells were common now in england . \\n `` is anything happening with the severn project ? '' \\n will asked . \\n `` that 's one of the things we could find out , '' greene said . \\n `` but i would expect a round trip with several stopovers in order to examine the most advanced methods of generating power . \\n there is a feeling that , despite the advances being made , nothing comparable to the traditional fuel sources has yet to make the grade . '' \\n will and harry sat up . \\n they were very keen to continue the venture their father had offered them . \\n `` how long for the leg ? '' \\n asked harry . \\n alan greene failed to follow harry 's train of thought and looked at him quizzically . \\n `` i mean , '' harry clarified , `` when do we start ? '' \\n `` the sooner the better , '' greene said . \\n `` harry was asking about your leg , '' will explained . \\n `` how long until it is fixed ? '' \\n `` oh , that 'll be a couple of months , easily , '' greene said casually . \\n `` big bone , the femur . '' \\n he registered the looks of disappointment on his sons ' faces and , at last , grasped the misunderstanding . \\n `` oh , i see . \\n you think you 've got to wait until i 'm fit . \\n is that it ? '' \\n again there were puzzled looks on the boys ' faces . \\n though he had congratulated his sons on the successful outcome of the mission to suriname , alan greene wanted to reward them . \\n on the table between them sat greene 's laptop . \\n `` i want to show you something , '' he said . \\n `` gather round . '' \\n he clicked on an icon and the machine picked up the wireless internet connection , opening greene 's home page . \\n `` i 've had some people working on this , '' he commented . \\n `` i think you 'll like it . '' \\n the web page showed a picture of a cluster of what looked like green plums . \\n `` they 're greengages , '' their father informed the boys . \\n beneath the picture , the web page intro began . \\n letters appeared one by one and spelled out a single word : g-r-e-e-n-e-g-a-u-g-e content buttons appeared across the top : home ; our aims ; who we are ; contact . \\n `` i was trying to think of a suitable name for the business and nothing beat the title of the video we saw before we went to suriname , '' greene explained . \\n `` you see , the greengage is a fruit -- a beautiful natural thing . \\n and with the slight change in the spelling -- an extra e and the u in gauge -- the word takes on extra meaning . '' \\n he paused . \\n `` greene , as in our name ; gauge , as in a tool for measuring ... '' `` yeah , we get it , dad ! '' \\n will laughed , raising his eyebrows at the unnecessary explanation . \\n harry smiled too but with less confidence . \\n `` we 're the greenes , '' will went on , an ironic tone in his voice . \\n `` we 're gauging what 's going on in the world . '' \\n `` yes , '' greene senior responded with enthusiasm . \\n `` and we hope to be a yardstick against which other businesses can measure their performance . '' \\n he clicked on the tab which read `` our aims '' . \\n the home page dissolved , to be replaced with a couple of paragraphs superimposed over a photograph of the rainforest . \\n will recognised the shot : he had taken it during their journey down the ezel . \\n he leaned towards the screen . \\n we are committed to business practices which do not jeopardise the wellbeing of planet earth . \\n we set our own standards which are far in excess of those required by the laws set down by governments around the world . \\n it is our aim to pursue business in a manner which is ethical in all respects . \\n we believe it is possible for profit and planet to coexist . \\n alan greene gave the boys time read the new company 's stated aims before clicking on the who we are tab . \\n three pictures appeared on screen , one of greene , one of will and one of harry . \\n underneath each shot was the appropriate name followed by the word , director . \\n `` as far as i 'm concerned , '' alan greene said , `` you are my business partners . \\n you proved yourselves in the surinamese jungle . \\n there 's no reason why you should n't go it alone . \\n boys -- i trust you to find out what we need to know about alternative energy sources . \\n report your findings to me and we 'll see where greenegauge should best invest . '' \\n `` really ? '' \\n both boys spoke together . \\n `` really , '' said their father . \\n will and harry stared at the screen . \\n it took a few seconds for them to realise the full meaning of what they were looking at . \\n their father had made them equal partners in his new business . \\n they knew he had referred to them as business partners , but this made it official . \\n they had an influence in what the new enterprise did , what it chose to invest in . \\n they each had a great deal of control over the way business would be conducted in the future . \\n each of them realised the level of responsibility and each was profoundly grateful to his father . \\n they would do their best not to let anyone down . \\n the earth 's future might just depend on them . \\n the end dedication . \\n for snippet tweed . \\n the sequel to greenegauge is due out at the end of 2015 . \\n other titles available from jago piran include : the devil 's own time , a dark tale of unimaginable evil . \\n what would you do if you uncovered a plot like this one ? \\n for a ya readership . \\n shoot the moon . \\n a ya novel telling the story of the first terrorist attacks on the near-space infrastructure of mankind 's attempt to solve the world 's energy crisis . \\n humanity 's fate falls into the hands of a schoolboy newly relocated to lunar city . \\n please feel free to contact the author at jago.piran@yahoo.co.uk with any comments or observations . \\n reviews for jago piran 's work : `` he writes slick , eminently readable prose .

their careless teeth ripped at my sleeves and snagged through my hair , pushed against my collarbone , the pulse at my neck . \\n i could have screamed , but i did n't . \\n i could have fought , but i did n't . \\n i just lay there and let it happen , watching the winter-white sky go gray above me . \\n one wolf prodded his nose into my hand and against my cheek , casting a shadow across my face . \\n his yellow eyes looked into mine while the other wolves jerked me this way and that . \\n i held on to those eyes for as long as i could . \\n yellow . \\n and , up close , flecked brilliantly with every shade of gold and hazel . \\n i did n't want him to look away , and he did n't . \\n i wanted to reach out and grab a hold of his ruff , but my hands stayed curled on my chest , my arms frozen to my body . \\n i could n't remember what it felt like to be warm . \\n then he was gone , and without him , the other wolves closed in , too close , suffocating . \\n something seemed to flutter in my chest . \\n there was no sun ; there was no light . \\n i was dying . \\n i could n't remember what the sky looked like . \\n but i did n't die . \\n i was lost to a sea of cold , and then i was reborn into a world of warmth . \\n i remember this : his yellow eyes . \\n i thought i 'd never see them again . \\n chapter two sam they snatched the girl off her tire swing in the backyard and dragged her into the woods ; her body made a shallow track in the snow , from her world to mine . \\n i saw it happen . \\n i did n't stop it . \\n it had been the longest , coldest winter of my life . \\n day after day under a pale , worthless sun . \\n and the hunger-hunger that burned and gnawed , an insatiable master . \\n that month nothing moved , the landscape frozen into a colorless diorama devoid of life . \\n one of us had been shot trying to steal trash off someone 's back step , so the rest of the pack stayed in the woods and slowly starved , waiting for warmth and our old bodies . \\n until they found the girl . \\n until they attacked . \\n they crouched around her , snarling and snapping , fighting to tear into the kill first . \\n i saw it . \\n i saw their flanks shuddering with their eagerness . \\n i saw them tug the girl 's body this way and that , wearing away the snow beneath her . \\n i saw muzzles smeared with red . \\n still , i did n't stop it . \\n i was high up in the pack-beck and paul had made sure of that-so i could 've moved in immediately , but i hung back , trembling with the cold , up to my ankles in snow . \\n the girl smelled warm , alive , human above all else . \\n what was wrong with her ? \\n if she was alive , why was n't she struggling ? \\n i could smell her blood , a warm , bright scent in this dead , cold world . \\n i saw salem jerk and tremble as he ripped at her clothing . \\n my stomach twisted , painful-it had been so long since i 'd eaten . \\n i wanted to push through the wolves to stand next to salem and pretend that i could n't smell her humanness or hear her soft moans . \\n she was so little underneath our wildness , the pack pressing against her , wanting to trade her life for ours . \\n with a snarl and a flash of teeth , i pushed forward . \\n salem growled back at me , but i was rangier than him , despite my starvation and youth . \\n paul rumbled threateningly to back me up . \\n i was next to her , and she was looking up at the endless sky with distant eyes . \\n maybe dead . \\n i pushed my nose into her hand ; the scent on her palm , all sugar and butter and salt , reminded me of another life . \\n then i saw her eyes . \\n awake . \\n alive . \\n the girl looked right at me , eyes holding mine with such terrible honesty . \\n i backed up , recoiled , starting to shake again-but this time , it was n't anger that racked my frame . \\n her eyes on my eyes . \\n her blood on my face . \\n i was tearing apart , inside and outside . \\n her life . \\n my life . \\n the pack fell back from me , wary . \\n they growled at me , no longer one of them , and they snarled over their prey . \\n i thought she was the most beautiful girl i 'd ever seen , a tiny , bloody angel in the snow , and they were going to destroy her . \\n i saw it . \\n i saw her , in a way i 'd never seen anything before . \\n and i stopped it . \\n chapter three grace 38of i saw him again after that , always in the cold . \\n he stood at the edge of the woods in our backyard , his yellow eyes steady on me as i filled the bird feeder or took out the trash , but he never came close . \\n in between day and night , a time that lasted forever in the long minnesota winter , i would cling to the frozen tire swing until i felt his gaze . \\n or , later , when i 'd outgrown the swing , i 'd step off the back deck and quietly approach him , hand forward , palm up , eyes lowered . \\n no threat . \\n i was trying to speak his language . \\n but no matter how long i waited , no matter how hard i tried to reach him , he would always melt into the undergrowth before i could cross the distance between us . \\n i was never afraid of him . \\n he was large enough to tear me from my swing , strong enough to knock me down and drag me into the woods . \\n but the ferocity of his body was n't in his eyes . \\n i remembered his gaze , every hue of yellow , and i could n't be afraid . \\n i knew he would n't hurt me . \\n i wanted him to know i would n't hurt him . \\n i waited . \\n and waited . \\n and he waited , too , though i did n't know what he was waiting for . \\n it felt like i was the only one reaching out . \\n but he was always there . \\n watching me watching him . \\n never any closer to me , but never any farther away , either . \\n and so it was an unbroken pattern for six years : the wolves ' haunting presence in the winter and their even more haunting absence in the summer . \\n i did n't really think about the timing . \\n i thought they were wolves . \\n only wolves . \\n chapter four sam 90of the day i nearly talked to grace was the hottest day of my life . \\n even in the bookstore , which was air-conditioned , the heat crept in around the door and came in through the big picture windows in waves . \\n behind the counter , i slouched on my stool in the sun and sucked in the summer as if i could hold every drop of it inside of me . \\n as the hours crept by , the afternoon sunlight bleached all the books on the shelves to pale , gilded versions of themselves and warmed the paper and ink inside the covers so that the smell of unread words hung in the air . \\n this was what i loved , when i was human . \\n i was reading when the door opened with a little ding , admitting a stifling rush of hot air and a group of girls . \\n they were laughing too loudly to need my help , so i kept reading and let them jostle along the walls and talk about everything except books . \\n i do n't think i would 've given the girls a second thought , except that at the edge of my vision i saw one of them sweep up her dark blonde hair and twist it into a long ponytail . \\n the action itself was insignificant , but the movement sent a gasp of scent into the air . \\n i recognized that smell . \\n i knew immediately . \\n it was her . \\n it had to be . \\n i jerked my book up toward my face and risked a glimpse in the girls ' direction . \\n the other two were still talking and gesturing at a paper bird i 'd hung from the ceiling above the children 's book section . \\n she was n't talking , though ; she hung back , her eyes on the books all around her . \\n i saw her face then , and i recognized something of myself in her expression . \\n her eyes flicked over the shelves , seeking possibilities for escape . \\n i had planned a thousand different versions of this scene in my head , but now that the moment had come , i did n't know what to do . \\n she was so real here . \\n it was different when she was in her backyard , just reading a book or scribbling homework in a notebook . \\n there , the distance between us was an impossible void ; i felt all the reasons to stay away . \\n here , in the bookstore , with me , she seemed breathtakingly close in a way she had n't before . \\n there was nothing to stop me from talking to her . \\n her gaze headed in my direction , and i looked away hurriedly , down at my book . \\n she would n't recognize my face but she would recognize my eyes . \\n i had to believe she would recognize my eyes . \\n i prayed for her to leave so i could breathe again . \\n i prayed for her to buy a book so i would have to talk to her . \\n one of the girls called , `` grace , come over here and look at this . \\n making the grade : getting into the college of your dreams-that sounds good , right ? '' \\n i sucked in a slow breath and watched her long sunlit back as she crouched and looked at the sat prep books with the other girls . \\n there was a certain tilt to her shoulders that seemed to indicate only polite interest ; she nodded as they pointed to other books , but she seemed distracted . \\n i watched the way the sunlight streamed through the windows , catching the individual flyaway hairs in her ponytail and turning each one into a shimmering gold strand . \\n her head moved almost imperceptibly back and forth with the rhythm of the music playing overhead . \\n `` hey . '' \\n i jerked back as a face appeared before me . \\n not grace . \\n one of the other girls , dark-haired and tanned . \\n she had a huge camera slung over her shoulder and she was looking right into my eyes . \\n she did n't say anything , but i knew what she was thinking . \\n reactions to my eye color ranged from furtive glances to out-and-out staring ; at least she was being honest about it . \\n `` do you mind if i take your photo ? '' \\n she asked . \\n i cast around for an excuse . \\n `` some native people think if you take their photo , you take their soul . \\n it sounds like a very logical argument to me , so sorry , no pictures . '' \\n i shrugged apologetically . \\n `` you can take photos of the store if you like . '' \\n the third girl pushed up against the camera girl : bushy light brown hair , tremendously freckled and radiating so much energy that she exhausted me . \\n `` flirting , olivia ? \\n we do n't have time for that . \\n here , dude , we 'll take this one . '' \\n i took making the grade from her , sparing a quick glance around for grace . \\n `` nineteen dollars and ninety-nine cents , '' i said . \\n my heart was pounding . \\n `` for a paperback ? '' \\n remarked the freckle girl , but she handed me a twenty . \\n `` keep the penny . '' \\n we did n't have a penny jar , but i put it on the counter next to the register . \\n i bagged the book and receipt slowly , thinking grace might come over to see what was taking so long . \\n but she stayed in the biography section , head tipped to the side as she read the spines . \\n the freckle girl took the bag and grinned at me and olivia . \\n then they went to grace and herded her toward the door . \\n turn around , grace . \\n look at me , i 'm standing right here . \\n if she turned right now , she 'd see my eyes , and she 'd have to know me . \\n freckle girl opened the door-ding-and made an impatient sound to the rest of the herd : time to move along . \\n olivia turned briefly , and her eyes found me again behind the counter . \\n i knew i was staring at them-at grace-but i could n't stop . \\n olivia frowned and ducked out of the store . \\n freckle girl said , `` grace , come on . '' \\n my chest ached , my body speaking a language my head did n't quite understand . \\n i waited . \\n but grace , the only person in the world i wanted to know me , just ran a wanting finger over the cover of one of the new hardcovers and walked out of the store without ever realizing i was there , right within reach . \\n chapter five grace 44of i did n't realize that the wolves in the wood were all werewolves until jack culpeper was killed . \\n september of my junior year , when it happened , jack was all anybody in our small town could talk about . \\n it was n't as though jack had been this amazing kid when he was alive-apart from owning the most expensive car in the parking lot , principal 's car included . \\n actually , he 'd been kind of a jerk . \\n but when he was killed-instant sainthood . \\n with a gruesome and sensational undertow , because of the way it had happened . \\n within five days of his death , i 'd heard a thousand versions of the story in the school halls . \\n the upshot was this : everyone was terrified of the wolves now . \\n because mom did n't usually watch the news and dad was terminally not home , the communal anxiety trickled down to our household slowly , taking a few days to really gain momentum . \\n my incident with the wolves had faded from my mother 's mind over the past six years , replaced by turpentine fumes and complementary colors , but jack 's attack seemed to refresh it perfectly . \\n far be it from mom to funnel her growing anxiety into something logical like spending more quality time with her only daughter , the one who had been attacked by wolves in the first place . \\n instead , she just used it to become even more scatter-brained than usual . \\n `` mom , do you need some help with dinner ? '' \\n my mother looked guiltily at me , turning her attention from the television that she could just see from the kitchen back to the mushrooms she was obliterating on the cutting board . \\n `` it was so close to here . \\n where they found him , '' mom said , pointing toward the television with the knife . \\n the news anchor looked insincerely sincere as a map of our county appeared next to a blurry photo of a wolf in the upper right corner of the screen . \\n the hunt for the truth , he said , continued . \\n you 'd think that after a week of reporting the same story over and over again , they 'd at least get their simple facts straight . \\n their photo was n't even the same species as my wolf , with his stormy gray coat and tawny yellow eyes . \\n `` i still ca n't believe it , '' mom went on . \\n `` just on the other side of boundary wood . \\n that 's where he was killed . '' \\n `` or died . '' \\n mom frowned at me , delicately frazzled and beautiful as usual . \\n `` what ? '' \\n i looked back up from my homework-comforting , orderly lines of numbers and symbols . \\n `` he could 've just passed out by the side of the road and been dragged into the woods while he was unconscious . \\n it 's not the same . \\n you ca n't just go around trying to cause a panic . '' \\n mom 's attention had wandered back to the screen as she chopped the mushrooms into pieces small enough for amoeba consumption . \\n she shook her head . \\n `` they attacked him , grace . '' \\n i glanced out the window at the woods , the pale lines of the trees phantoms against the dark . \\n if my wolf was out there , i could n't see him . \\n `` mom , you 're the one who told me over and over and over again : wolves are usually peaceful . '' \\n wolves are peaceful creatures . \\n this had been mom 's refrain for years . \\n i think the only way she could keep living in this house was by convincing herself of the wolves ' relative harmlessness and insisting that my attack was a one-time event . \\n i do n't know if she really believed that they were peaceful , but i did . \\n gazing into the woods , i 'd watched the wolves every year of my life , memorizing their faces and their personalities . \\n sure , there was the lean , sickly-looking brindle wolf who hung well back in the woods , only visible in the coldest of months . \\n everything about him-his dull scraggly coat , his notched ear , his one foul running eye-shouted an ill body , and the rolling whites of his wild eyes whispered of a diseased mind . \\n i remembered his teeth grazing my skin . \\n i could imagine him attacking a human in the woods again . \\n and there was the white she-wolf . \\n i had read that wolves mated for life , and i 'd seen her with the pack leader , a heavyset wolf that was as black as she was white . \\n i 'd watched him nose her muzzle and lead her through the skeleton trees , fur flashing like fish in water . \\n she had a sort of savage , restless beauty to her ; i could imagine her attacking a human , too . \\n but the rest of them ? \\n they were silent , beautiful ghosts in the woods . \\n i did n't fear them . \\n `` right , peaceful . '' \\n mom hacked at the cutting board . \\n `` maybe they should just trap them all and dump them in canada or something . '' \\n i frowned at my homework . \\n summers without my wolf were bad enough . \\n as a child , those months had seemed impossibly long , just time spent waiting for the wolves to reappear . \\n they 'd only gotten worse after i noticed my yellow-eyed wolf . \\n during those long months , i had imagined great adventures where i became a wolf by night and ran away with my wolf to a golden wood where it never snowed . \\n i knew now that the golden wood did n't exist , but the pack-and my yellow-eyed wolf-did . \\n sighing , i pushed my math book across the kitchen table and joined mom at the cutting board . \\n `` let me do it . \\n you 're just messing it up . '' \\n she did n't protest , and i had n't expected her to . \\n instead , she rewarded me with a smile and whirled away as if she 'd been waiting for me to notice the pitiful job she was doing . \\n `` if you finish making dinner , '' she said , `` i 'll love you forever . '' \\n i made a face and took the knife from her . \\n mom was permanently paint-spattered and absentminded . \\n she would never be my friends ' moms : apron-wearing , meal-cooking , vacuuming , betty crocker . \\n i did n't really want her to be like them . \\n but seriously-i needed to get my homework done . \\n `` thanks , sweetie . \\n i 'll be in the studio . '' \\n if mom had been one of those dolls that say five or six different things when you push their tummy , that would 've been one of her prerecorded phrases . \\n `` do n't pass out from the fumes , '' i told her , but she was already running up the stairs . \\n shoving the mutilated mushrooms into a bowl , i looked at the clock hanging on the bright yellow wall . \\n still an hour until dad would be home from work . \\n i had plenty of time to make dinner and maybe , afterward , to try to catch a glimpse of my wolf . \\n there was some sort of cut of beef in the fridge that was probably supposed to go with the mangled mushrooms . \\n i pulled it out and slapped it on the cutting board . \\n in the background , an `` expert '' on the news asked whether the wolf population in minnesota should be limited or moved . \\n the whole thing just put me in a bad mood . \\n the phone rang . \\n `` hello ? '' \\n `` hiya . \\n what 's up ? '' \\n rachel . \\n i was glad to hear from her ; she was the exact opposite of my mother-totally organized and great on followthrough . \\n she made me feel less like an alien . \\n i shoved the phone between my ear and my shoulder and chopped the beef as i talked , saving a piece the size of my fist for later . \\n `` just making dinner and watching the stupid news . '' \\n she knew immediately what i was talking about . \\n `` i know . \\n talk about surreal , right ? \\n it seems like they just ca n't get enough of it . \\n it 's kind of gross , really-i mean , why ca n't they just shut up and let us get over it ? \\n it 's bad enough going to school and hearing about it all the time . \\n and you with the wolves and everything , it 's got to be really bothering you-and , seriously , jack 's parents have got to be just wanting the reporters to shut up . '' \\n rachel was babbling so fast i could barely understand her . \\n i missed a bunch of what she said in the middle , and then she asked , `` has olivia called tonight ? '' \\n olivia was the third side of our trio , the only one who came anywhere near understanding my fascination with the wolves . \\n it was a rare night when i did n't talk to either her or rachel by phone . \\n `` she 's probably out shooting photos . \\n is n't there a meteor shower tonight ? '' \\n i said . \\n olivia saw the world through her camera ; half of my school memories seemed to be in four-by-six-inch glossy black-and-white form . \\n rachel said , `` i think you 're right . \\n olivia will definitely want a piece of that hot asteroid action . \\n got a moment to talk ? '' \\n i glanced at the clock . \\n `` sorta . \\n just while i finish up dinner , then i have homework . '' \\n `` okay . \\n just a second then . \\n two words , baby , try them out : es . \\n cape . '' \\n i started the beef browning on the stove top . \\n `` that 's one word , rach . '' \\n she paused . \\n `` yeah . \\n it sounded better in my head . \\n anyway , so here 's the thing : my parents said if i want to go someplace over christmas break this year , they 'll pay for it . \\n i so want to go somewhere . \\n anywhere but mercyfalls . \\n god , anywhere but mercyfalls ! \\n will you and olivia come over and help me pick something after school tomorrow ? '' \\n `` yeah , sure . '' \\n `` if it 's someplace really cool , maybe you and olivia could come , too , '' rachel said . \\n i did n't answer right away . \\n the word christmas immediately evoked memories of the scent of our christmas tree , the dark infinity of the starry december sky above the backyard , and my wolf 's eyes watching me from behind the snow-covered trees . \\n no matter how absent he was for the rest of the year , i always had my wolf for christmas . \\n rachel groaned . \\n `` do n't do that silent staring-off-into-the - distance-thinking look , grace ! \\n i can tell you 're doing it ! \\n you ca n't tell me you do n't want to get out of this place ! '' \\n i sort of did n't . \\n i sort of belonged here . \\n `` i did n't say no , '' i protested . \\n `` you also did n't say omigod yes , either . \\n that 's what you were supposed to say . '' \\n rachel sighed . \\n `` but you will come over , right ? '' \\n `` you know i will , '' i said , craning my neck to squint out the back window . \\n `` now , i really have to go . '' \\n `` yeah yeah yeah , '' rachel said . \\n `` bring cookies . \\n do n't forget . \\n love ya . \\n bye . '' \\n she laughed and hung up . \\n i hurried to get the pot of stew simmering on the stove so it could occupy itself without me . \\n grabbing my coat from the hooks on the wall , i pulled open the sliding door to the deck . \\n cool air bit my cheeks and pinched at the tops of my ears , reminding me that summer was officially over . \\n my stocking cap was stuffed in the pocket of my coat , but i knew my wolf did n't always recognize me when i was wearing it , so i left it off . \\n i squinted at the edge of the yard and stepped off the deck , trying to look nonchalant as i did . \\n the piece of beef in my hand felt cold and slick . \\n i crunched out across the brittle , colorless grass into the middle of the yard and stopped , momentarily dazzled by the violent pink of the sunset through the fluttering black leaves of the trees . \\n this stark landscape was a world away from the small , warm kitchen with its comforting smells of easy survival . \\n where i was supposed to belong . \\n where i should 've wanted to be . \\n but the trees called to me , urging me to abandon what i knew and vanish into the oncoming night . \\n it was a desire that had been tugging me with disconcerting frequency these days . \\n the darkness at the edge of the wood shifted , and i saw my wolf standing beside a tree , nostrils sniffing toward the meat in my hand . \\n my relief at seeing him was cut short as he shifted his head , letting the yellow square of light from the sliding door fall across his face . \\n i could see now that his chin was crusted with old , dried blood . \\n days old . \\n his nostrils worked ; he could smell the bit of beef in my hand . \\n either the beef or the familiarity of my presence was enough to lure him a few steps out of the wood . \\n then a few steps more . \\n closer than he 'd ever been before . \\n i faced him , near enough that i could have reached out and touched his dazzling fur . \\n or brushed the deep red stain on his muzzle . \\n i badly wanted that blood to be his . \\n an old cut or scratch earned in a scuffle . \\n but it did n't look like that . \\n it looked like it belonged to someone else . \\n `` did you kill him ? '' \\n i whispered . \\n he did n't disappear at the sound of my voice , as i had expected . \\n he was as still as a statue , his eyes watching my face instead of the meat in my hand . \\n `` it 's all they can talk about on the news , '' i said , as if he could understand . \\n `` they called it ` savage . ' \\n they said wild animals did it . \\n did you do it ? '' \\n he stared at me for a minute longer , motionless , unblinking . \\n and then , for the first time in six years , he closed his eyes . \\n it went against every natural instinct a wolf should have possessed . \\n a lifetime of an unblinking gaze , and now he was frozen in almost-human grief , brilliant eyes closed , head ducked and tail lowered . \\n it was the saddest thing i had ever seen . \\n slowly , barely moving , i approached him , afraid only of scaring him away , not of his scarlet-stained lips or the teeth they hid . \\n his ears flicked , acknowledging my presence , but he did n't move . \\n i crouched , dropping the meat onto the snow beside me . \\n he flinched as it landed . \\n i was close enough to smell the wild odor of his coat and feel the warmth of his breath . \\n then i did what i had always wanted to-i put a hand to his dense ruff , and when he did n't flinch , i buried both my hands in his fur . \\n his outer coat was not soft as it looked , but beneath the coarse guard hairs was a layer of downy fluff . \\n with a low groan , he pressed his head against me , eyes still closed . \\n i held him as if he were no more than a family dog , though his wild , sharp scent would n't let me forget what he really was . \\n for a moment , i forgot where-who-i was . \\n for a moment , it did n't matter . \\n movement caught my eye : far off , barely visible in the fading day , the white wolf was watching at the edge of the wood , her eyes burning . \\n i felt a rumble against my body and i realized my wolf was growling at her . \\n the she-wolf stepped closer , uncommonly bold , and he twisted in my arms to face her . \\n i flinched at the sound of his teeth snapping at her . \\n she never growled , and somehow that was worse . \\n a wolf should have growled . \\n but she just stared , eyes flicking from him to me , every aspect of her body language breathing hatred . \\n still rumbling , almost inaudible , my wolf pressed harder against me , forcing me back a step , then another , guiding me up to the deck . \\n my feet found the steps and i retreated to the sliding door . \\n he remained at the bottom of the stairs until i pushed the door open and locked myself inside the house . \\n as soon as i was inside , the white wolf darted forward and snatched the piece of meat i 'd dropped . \\n though my wolf was nearest to her and the most obvious threat for the food , it was me that her eyes found , on the other side of the glass door . \\n she held my gaze for a long moment before she slid into the woods like a spirit . \\n my wolf hesitated by the edge of the woods , the dim porch light catching his eyes . \\n he was still watching my silhouette through the door . \\n i pressed my palm flat against the frigid glass . \\n the distance between us had never felt so vast . \\n chapter six grace 42of when my father got home , i was still lost in the silent world of the wolves , imagining again and again the feeling of my wolf 's coarse hairs against my palms . \\n even though i 'd reluctantly washed my hands to finish up dinner , his musky scent lingered on my clothing , keeping the encounter fresh in my mind . \\n it had taken six years for him to let me touch him . \\n hold him . \\n and now he 'd guarded me , just like he 'd always guarded me . \\n i desperately wanted to tell somebody , but i knew dad would n't share my excitement , especially with the newscasters still droning in the background about the attack . \\n i kept my mouth shut . \\n in the front hall , dad stomped in . \\n even though he had n't seen me in the kitchen , he called , `` dinner smells good , grace . '' \\n he came into the kitchen and patted me on the head . \\n his eyes looked tired behind his glasses , but he smiled . \\n `` where 's your mother ? \\n painting ? '' \\n he chucked his coat over a chair . \\n `` does she ever stop ? '' \\n i narrowed my eyes at his coat . \\n `` i know you are n't going to leave that there . '' \\n he retrieved it with an affable smile and called up the stairs , `` rags , time for dinner ! '' \\n his use of mom 's nickname confirmed his good mood . \\n mom appeared in the yellow kitchen in two seconds flat . \\n she was out of breath from running down the stairs-she never walked anywhere-and there was a streak of green paint on her cheekbone . \\n dad kissed her , avoiding the paint . \\n `` have you been a good girl , my pet ? '' \\n she batted her eyelashes . \\n she had a look on her face like she already knew what he was going to say . \\n `` the best . '' \\n `` and you , gracie ? '' \\n `` better than mom . '' \\n dad cleared his throat . \\n `` ladies and gentlemen , my raise takes effect this friday . \\n so ... '' mom clapped her hands and whirled in a circle , watching herself in the hall mirror as she spun . \\n `` i 'm renting that place downtown ! '' \\n dad grinned and nodded . \\n `` and , gracie girl , you 're trading in your piece of crap car as soon as i find time to get you down to the dealership . \\n i 'm tired of taking yours into the shop . '' \\n mom laughed , giddy , and clapped her hands again . \\n she danced into the kitchen , chanting some sort of nonsense song . \\n if she rented the studio in town , i 'd probably never see either of my parents again . \\n well , except for dinner . \\n they usually showed up for food . \\n but that seemed unimportant in comparison to the promise of reliable transportation . \\n `` really ? \\n my own car ? \\n i mean , one that runs ? '' \\n `` a slightly less crappy one , '' dad promised . \\n `` nothing nice . '' \\n i hugged him . \\n a car like that meant freedom . \\n that night , i lay in my room , eyes squeezed firmly shut , trying to sleep . \\n the world outside my window seemed silenced , as though it had snowed . \\n it was too early for snow , but every sound seemed muffled . \\n too quiet . \\n i held my breath and focused on the night , listening for movement in the still darkness . \\n i slowly became aware that faint clicks had broken the silence outside , pricking at my ears . \\n it sounded for all the world like toenails on the deck outside my window . \\n was a wolf on the deck ? \\n maybe it was a raccoon . \\n then came more soft scrabbling , and a growl-definitely not a raccoon . \\n the hairs rose on the back of my neck . \\n pulling my quilt around me like a cape , i climbed out of bed and padded across bare floorboards lit by half a moon . \\n i hesitated , wondering if i 'd dreamed the sound , but the tack tack tack came through the window again . \\n i lifted the blinds and looked out onto the deck . \\n perpendicular to my room , i could see that the yard was empty . \\n the stark black trunks of the trees jutted like a fence between me and the deeper forest beyond . \\n suddenly , a face appeared directly in front of mine , and i jumped with surprise . \\n the white wolf was on the other side of the glass , paws on the outside sill . \\n she was close enough that i could see moisture caught in the banded hairs of her fur . \\n her jewel-blue eyes glared into mine , challenging me to look away . \\n a low growl rumbled through the glass , and i felt as if i could read meaning into it , as clearly as if it were written on the pane . \\n you 're not his to protect . \\n i stared back at her . \\n then , without thinking , i lifted my teeth into a snarl . \\n the growl that escaped from me surprised both me and her , and she jumped down from the window . \\n she cast a dark look over her shoulder at me and peed on the corner of the deck before loping into the woods . \\n biting my lip to erase the strange shape of the snarl , i picked up my sweater from the floor and crawled back into bed . \\n shoving my pillow aside , i balled up the sweater to use instead . \\n i fell asleep to the scent of my wolf . \\n pine needles , cold rain , earthy perfume , coarse bristles on my face . \\n it was almost like he was there . \\n chapter seven sam 42of i could still smell her on my fur . \\n it clung to me , a memory of another world . \\n i was drunk with it , with the scent of her . \\n i 'd gotten too close . \\n my instincts warned against it . \\n especially when i remembered what had just happened to the boy . \\n the smell of summer on her skin , the half-recalled cadence of her voice , the sensation of her fingers on my fur . \\n every bit of me sang with the memory of her closeness . \\n too close . \\n i could n't stay away . \\n chapter eight grace 65of for the next week , i was distracted in school , floating through my classes and barely taking any notes . \\n all i could think of was the feel of my wolf 's fur under my fingers and the image of the white wolf 's snarling face outside my window . \\n i snapped to attention , however , when mrs. ruminski led a policeman into the classroom and to the front of our life skills class . \\n she left him alone at the front of the room , which i thought was pretty cruel , considering it was seventh period and most of us were restlessly anticipating escape . \\n maybe she thought that a member of law enforcement would be able to handle mere high school students . \\n but criminals you can shoot , unlike a room full of juniors who wo n't shut up . \\n `` hi , '' the officer said . \\n beneath a gun belt that bristled with holsters and pepper sprays and other assorted weaponry , he looked young . \\n he glanced toward mrs. ruminski , who hovered unhelpfully in the open door of the classroom , and fingered the shiny name tag on his shirt : william koenig . \\n mrs. ruminski had told us that he was a graduate of our fine high school , but neither his name nor his face looked particularly familiar to me . \\n `` i 'm officer koenig . \\n your teacher-mrs . \\n ruminski-asked me last week if i 'd come talk to her life skills class . '' \\n i glanced over at olivia in the seat next to me to see what she was making of this . \\n as usual , everything about olivia looked neat and tidy : straight-a report card made flesh . \\n her dark hair was plaited in a perfect french braid and her collared shirt was freshly pressed . \\n you could never tell what olivia was thinking by her mouth . \\n it was her eyes you had to look at . \\n `` he 's cute , '' olivia whispered to me . \\n `` love the shaved head . \\n do you think his mom calls him ` will ' ? '' \\n i had n't yet figured out how to respond to olivia 's new-found and very vocal interest in guys , so i just rolled my eyes . \\n he was cute , but not my type . \\n i did n't think i knew what my type was yet . \\n `` i became an officer of the law right after high school , '' officer will said . \\n he looked very serious as he said it , frowning in a sort of serve-and-protect way . \\n `` it 's a profession i always wanted to pursue and one i take very seriously . '' \\n `` clearly , '' i whispered to olivia . \\n i did n't think his mother called him will . \\n officer william koenig shot a look at us and rested a hand on his gun . \\n i guess it was habit , but it looked like he was considering shooting us for whispering . \\n olivia disappeared into her seat and a few of the other girls giggled . \\n `` it 's an excellent career path and one of the few that does n't require college yet , '' he pressed on . \\n `` are-uh-any of you considering going into law enforcement ? '' \\n it was the uh that did him in . \\n if he had n't hesitated , i think the class might have behaved . \\n a hand whipped up . \\n elizabeth , one of the hordes of mercy falls high students still wearing black since jack 's death , asked , `` is it true that jack culpeper 's body was stolen from the morgue ? '' \\n the class erupted in whispers at her audacity , and officer koenig looked as if he really did have due cause to shoot her . \\n but all he said was , `` i 'm not really authorized to talk about the details of any ongoing investigations . '' \\n `` it 's an investigation ? '' \\n a male voice called out from near the front . \\n elizabeth interrupted , `` my mom heard it from a dispatcher . \\n is it true ? \\n why would someone steal a body ? '' \\n theories flew in quick succession . \\n `` it 's got to be a cover-up . \\n for a suicide . '' \\n `` to smuggle drugs ! '' \\n `` medical experimentation ! '' \\n some guy said , `` i heard jack 's dad has a stuffed polar bear in his house . \\n maybe the culpepers stuffed jack , too . '' \\n someone took a swat at the guy who made the last comment ; it was still taboo to say anything bad about jack or his family . \\n officer koenig looked aghast at mrs. ruminski , who stood in the open door of the classroom . \\n she regarded him solemnly and then turned to the class . \\n `` quiet down ! '' \\n we quieted down . \\n she turned back to officer koenig . \\n `` so was his body sto - len ? '' \\n she asked . \\n he said again , `` i 'm not really authorized to discuss the details of any ongoing investigations . '' \\n but this time , he sounded more helpless , like there might be a question mark at the end of his sentence . \\n `` officer koenig , '' mrs. ruminski said . \\n `` jack was well loved in this community . '' \\n which was a patent lie . \\n but being dead had done wonders for his reputation . \\n i guess everyone else could forget the way he 'd lose his temper in the middle of the hall or even during class . \\n and just what those tempers looked like . \\n but i had n't . \\n mercyfalls was all about rumors , and the rumor on jack was that he got his short fuse from his dad . \\n i did n't know about that . \\n it seemed like you ought to pick the sort of person you would be , no matter what your parents were like . \\n `` we are still in mourning , '' mrs. ruminski added , gesturing to the sea of black in the classroom . \\n `` this is not about an investigation . \\n this is about giving closure to a close-knit community . '' \\n olivia mouthed at me : `` oh . \\n my . \\n god . '' \\n i shook my head . \\n amazing . \\n officer koenig crossed his arms over his chest ; it made him look petulant , like a little kid being forced to do something . \\n `` it 's true . \\n we 're looking into it . \\n i understand the loss of someone so young '' - this from someone who looked maybe twenty - `` has a huge impact on the community , but i ask that everyone respect the privacy of the family and the confidentiality of the investigation process . '' \\n he was getting back on firm footing here . \\n elizabeth waved her hand again . \\n `` do you think the wolves are dangerous ? \\n do you get lots of calls about them ? \\n my mom said you got lots of calls about them . '' \\n officer koenig looked at mrs. ruminski , but he should have figured out by now that she wanted to know just as much as elizabeth did . \\n `` i do n't think the wolves are a threat to the populace , no . \\n i-and the rest of the department-feel this was an isolated incident . '' \\n elizabeth said , `` but she got attacked , too . '' \\n oh , lovely . \\n i could n't see elizabeth pointing , but i knew she was , because everyone 's faces turned toward me . \\n i bit the inside of my lip . \\n not because the attention bothered me , but because every time someone remembered i was dragged from my tire swing , they remembered it could happen to anyone . \\n and i wondered how many someones it would take before they decided to go after the wolves . \\n to go after my wolf . \\n i knew this was the real reason why i could n't forgive jack for dying . \\n in between that and his checkered history at the school , it felt hypocritical to go into public mourning along with the rest of the school . \\n it did n't feel right to ignore it , either , though ; i wished i knew what i was supposed to be feeling . \\n `` that was a long time ago , '' i told officer koenig , and he looked relieved as i added , `` years . \\n and it might have been dogs . '' \\n so i was lying . \\n who was going to contradict me ? \\n `` exactly , '' officer koenig said emphatically . \\n `` exactly . \\n there 's no point vilifying wild animals for a random incident . \\n and there 's no point creating panic when it 's not warranted . \\n panic leads to carelessness , and carelessness creates accidents . '' \\n my thoughts precisely . \\n i felt a vague kinship with humorless officer koenig as he steered the conversation back to careers in law enforcement . \\n after class was over , the other students started talking about jack again , but olivia and i escaped to our lockers . \\n i felt a tug on my hair and turned to see rachel standing behind me , looking mournfully at both of us . \\n `` babes , i have to rain check on vacation planning this afternoon . \\n step-freak has demanded a family bonding trip to duluth . \\n if she wants me to love her , she 's going to have to buy me some new shoes . \\n can we get together tomorrow or something ? '' \\n i had barely nodded before rachel flashed both of us a big smile and surged off through the hall . \\n `` want to hang out at my place instead ? '' \\n i asked olivia . \\n it still felt weird to ask . \\n in middle school , she and rachel and i had hung out every day , a wordless ongoing agreement . \\n somehow it had sort of changed after rachel got her first boyfriend , leaving olivia and me behind , the geek and the disinterested , and fracturing our easy friendship . \\n `` sure , '' olivia said , grabbing her stuff to follow me down the hall . \\n she pinched my elbow . \\n `` look . '' \\n she pointed to isabel , jack 's younger sister , a classmate of ours with more than her fair share of the culpeper good looks , complete with a cherubic head of blonde curls . \\n she drove a white suv and had one of those handbag chihuahuas that she dressed to match her outfits . \\n i always wondered when she would notice that she lived in mercy falls , minnesota , where people just did n't do that kind of thing . \\n at the moment , isabel was staring into her locker as if it contained other worlds . \\n olivia said , `` she 's not wearing black . '' \\n isabel snapped out of her trance and glared at us as if she realized we were talking about her . \\n i looked away quickly , but i still felt her eyes on me . \\n `` maybe she 's not in mourning anymore , '' i said , after we 'd gotten out of earshot . \\n olivia opened the door for me . \\n `` maybe she 's the only one who ever was . '' \\n back at my house , i made coffee and cranberry scones for us , and we sat at the kitchen table looking at a stack of olivia 's latest photos under the yellow ceiling light . \\n to olivia , photography was a religion ; she worshipped her camera and studied the techniques as if they were rules to live by . \\n seeing her photos , i was almost willing to become a believer , too . \\n she made you feel as though you were right there in the scene . \\n `` he was really cute . \\n you ca n't tell me he was n't , '' she said . \\n `` are you still talking about officer no-smile ? \\n what is wrong with you ? '' \\n i shook my head and shuffled to the next photo . \\n `` i 've never seen you obsess over a real person . '' \\n olivia grinned and leaned at me over a steaming mug . \\n taking a bite of scone , she spoke around a mouthful , covering her mouth to keep from spraying me with crumbs . \\n `` i think i 'm turning into one of those girls who likes uniformed types . \\n oh , c'mon , you did n't think he was cute ? \\n i 'm feeling ... i 'm feeling the boyfriend urge . \\n we should order pizza sometime . \\n rachel told me there 's a really cute pizza boy . '' \\n i rolled my eyes again . \\n `` all of a sudden you want a boyfriend ? '' \\n olivia did n't look up from the photos , but i got the idea she was paying a lot of attention to my response . \\n `` you do n't ? '' \\n i mumbled , `` when the right guy comes along , i guess . '' \\n `` how will you know if you do n't look ? '' \\n `` as if you have ever had the guts to talk to a guy . \\n other than your james dean poster . '' \\n my voice had gotten more combative than i 'd intended ; i added a laugh at the end to soften the effect . \\n olivia 's eyebrows drew closer to each other , but she did n't say anything . \\n for a long time we sat in silence , paging through her photos . \\n i lingered on a close-up shot of me , olivia , and rachel together ; her mother had come outside to take it right before school started . \\n rachel , her freckled face contorted into a wild smile , had one arm firmly wrapped around olivia 's shoulders and the other around mine ; it looked like she was squeezing us into the frame . \\n like always , she was the glue that held our threesome together : the outgoing one who made sure us quiet ones stuck together through the years . \\n in the photo , olivia seemed to belong in the summer , with her olive skin bronzed and green eyes saturated with color . \\n her teeth made a perfect crescent moon smile for the photo , dimples and all . \\n next to the two of them , i was the embodiment of winter-dark blonde hair and serious brown eyes , a summer girl faded by cold . \\n i used to think olivia and i were so similar , both introverts permanently buried in books . \\n but now i realized my seclusion was self-inflicted and olivia was just painfully shy . \\n this year , it felt like the more time we spent together , the harder it was to stay friends . \\n `` i look stupid in that one , '' olivia said . \\n `` rachel looks insane . \\n and you look angry . '' \\n i looked like someone who would n't take no for an answer-petulant , almost . \\n i liked it . \\n `` you do n't look stupid . \\n you look like a princess and i look like an ogre . '' \\n `` you do n't look like an ogre . '' \\n `` i was bragging , '' i told her . \\n `` and rachel ? '' \\n `` no , you called it . \\n she does look insane . \\n or at least highly caffeinated , as per usual . '' \\n i looked at the photo again . \\n really , rachel looked like a sun , bright and exuding energy , holding us two moons in parallel orbit by the sheer force of her will . \\n `` did you see that one ? '' \\n olivia interrupted my thoughts to point at another one of the photos . \\n it was my wolf , deep in the woods , halfway hidden behind a tree . \\n but she 'd managed to get a little sliver of his face perfectly in focus , and his eyes stared right into mine . \\n `` you can keep that one . \\n in fact , keep the whole stack . \\n we can put the good ones in a book next time . '' \\n `` thanks , '' i replied , and meant it more than i could say . \\n i pointed at the picture . \\n `` this is from last week ? '' \\n she nodded . \\n i stared at the photo of him-breathtaking , but flat and inadequate in comparison to the real thing . \\n i lightly ran my thumb over it , as if i 'd feel his fur . \\n something knotted in my chest , bitter and sad . \\n i felt olivia 's eyes on me , and they only made me feel worse , more alone . \\n once upon a time i would 've talked to her about it , but now it felt too personal . \\n something had changed-and i thought it was me . \\n olivia handed me a slender stack of prints that she 'd separated from the rest . \\n `` this is my brag pile . '' \\n distracted , i paged through them slowly . \\n they were impressive : a fall leaf floating on a puddle , students reflected in the windows of a school bus , an artfully smudgy black-and-white self-portrait of olivia . \\n i oohed and aahed and then slid the photo of my wolf back on top of them to look at it again . \\n olivia made a sort of irritated sound in the back of her throat . \\n i hurriedly shuffled back to the one of the leaf floating on the puddle . \\n i frowned at it for a moment , trying to imagine the sort of thing mom would say about a piece of art . \\n i managed , `` i like this one . \\n it 's got great ... colors . '' \\n she snatched them out of my hands and flicked the wolf photo back at me with such force that it bounced off my chest and onto the floor . \\n `` yeah . \\n sometimes , grace , i do n't know why i even ... '' olivia did n't end the sentence , just shook her head . \\n i did n't get it . \\n did she want me to pretend to like the other photos better than the one of my wolf ? \\n `` hello ! \\n anyone home ? '' \\n it was john , olivia 's older brother , sparing me from the consequences of whatever i 'd done to irritate olivia . \\n he grinned at me from the front hall , shutting the door behind him . \\n `` hey , good-looking . '' \\n olivia looked up from her seat at the kitchen table with a frosty expression . \\n `` i hope you 're talking about me . '' \\n `` of course , '' john said , looking at me . \\n he was handsome in a very conventional way : tall , dark-haired like his sister , but with a face quick to smile and befriend . \\n `` it would be in very bad taste to hit on your sister 's best friend . \\n so . \\n it 's four o'clock . \\n how time flies when you 're '' - he paused , looking at olivia leaning over the table with a pile of photographs and me across from her with another stack - `` doing nothing . \\n ca n't you do nothing by yourselves ? '' \\n olivia silently straightened up her pile of photos while i explained , `` we 're introverts . \\n we like doing nothing together . \\n all talk , no action . '' \\n `` sounds fascinating . \\n olive , we 've got to leave now if you want to make it to your lesson . '' \\n he punched my arm lightly . \\n `` hey , why do n't you come with us , grace ? \\n are your parents home ? '' \\n i snorted . \\n `` are you kidding ? \\n i 'm raising myself . \\n i should get a head of household bonus on my taxes . '' \\n john laughed , probably more than my comment warranted , and olivia shot me a look imbued with enough venom to kill small animals . \\n i shut up . \\n `` come on , olive , '' said john , seemingly oblivious to the daggers flying from his sister 's eyes . \\n `` you pay for the lesson whether you get there or not . \\n you coming , grace ? '' \\n i looked out the window , and for the first time in months , i imagined disappearing into the trees and running until i found my wolf in a summer wood . \\n i shook my head . \\n `` not this time . \\n rain check ? '' \\n john flashed a lopsided smile at me . \\n `` yep . \\n come on , olive . \\n bye , good-looking . \\n you know who to call if you 're looking for some action with your talk . '' \\n olivia swung her backpack at him ; it made a solid thuk as it hit his body . \\n but it was me who got the dark look again , like i 'd done anything to encourage john 's flirting . \\n `` go . \\n just go . \\n bye , grace . '' \\n i showed them to the door and then returned aimlessly to the kitchen . \\n a pleasantly neutral voice followed me , an announcer on npr describing the classical piece i 'd just heard and introducing another one ; dad had left the radio on in his study next to the kitchen . \\n somehow , the sounds of my parents ' presence only highlighted their absence . \\n knowing that dinner would be canned beans unless i made it , i rummaged in the fridge and put a pot of leftover soup on the stove to simmer until my parents got home . \\n i stood in the kitchen , illuminated by the slanting cool afternoon light through the deck door , feeling sorry for myself , more because of olivia 's photo than because of the empty house . \\n i had n't seen my wolf in person since that day i 'd touched him , nearly a week ago , and even though i knew it should n't , his absence still stabbed . \\n it was stupid , the way i needed his phantom at the edge of the yard to feel complete . \\n stupid but completely incurable . \\n i went to the back door and opened it , wanting to smell the woods . \\n i padded out onto the deck in my sock feet and leaned against the railing . \\n if i had n't gone outside , i do n't know if i would have heard the scream . \\n chapter nine grace 58of from the distance beyond the trees , the scream came again . \\n for a second i thought it was a howl , and then the cry resolved itself into words : `` help ! \\n help ! '' \\n i swore the voice sounded like jack culpeper 's . \\n but that was impossible . \\n i was just imagining it , remembering it from the cafeteria , where it had always seemed to carry over the others around him as he catcalled girls in the hallway . \\n still , i followed the sound of the voice , moving impulsively across the yard and through the trees . \\n the ground was damp and prickly through my sock feet ; i was clumsier without my shoes . \\n the crashing of my own steps through fallen leaves and tangled brush drowned out any other sounds . \\n i hesitated , listening . \\n the voice was gone , replaced by just a whimper , distinctly animal-sounding , and then by silence . \\n the relative safety of the backyard was far behind me now . \\n i stood for a long moment , listening for any indication of where the first scream had come from . \\n i knew i had n't imagined it . \\n but there was nothing but silence . \\n and in that silence , the smell of the woods seeped under my skin and reminded me of him . \\n crushed pine needles and wet earth and wood smoke . \\n i did n't care how idiotic it was . \\n i 'd come into the woods this far . \\n going a little farther to try to see my wolf again would n't hurt anybody . \\n i retreated to the house , just long enough to get my shoes , and headed back out into the cool autumn day . \\n there was a bite behind the breeze that promised winter , but the sun shone bright , and under the shelter of the trees , the air was warm with the memory of hot days not so long ago . \\n all around me , leaves were dying gorgeously in red and orange ; crows cawed to each other overhead in a vibrant , ugly soundtrack . \\n i had n't been this far into these woods since i was eleven , when i 'd awoken surrounded by wolves , but strangely , i did n't feel afraid . \\n i stepped carefully , avoiding the little streams that snaked through the underbrush . \\n this should have been unfamiliar territory , but i felt confident , assured . \\n silently guided , as though by a weird sixth sense , i followed the same worn paths that the wolves used over and over again . \\n of course i knew it was n't really a sixth sense . \\n it was just me , acknowledging that there was more to my senses than i normally let on . \\n i gave in to them and they became efficient , sharpened . \\n as it reached me , the breeze seemed to carry the information of a stack of maps , telling me which animals had traveled where and how long ago . \\n my ears picked up faint sounds that before had gone unnoticed : the rustling of a twig as a bird built a nest overhead , the soft step of a deer dozens of feet away . \\n i felt like i was home . \\n the woods rang with an unfamiliar cry , out of place in this world . \\n i hesitated , listening . \\n the whimper came again , louder than before . \\n rounding a pine tree , i came upon the source : three wolves . \\n it was the white wolf and the black pack leader ; the sight of the she-wolf made my stomach twist with nerves . \\n the two of them had pounced on a third wolf , a scraggly young male with an almost-blue tint to his gray coat and an ugly , healing wound on his shoulder . \\n the other two wolves were pinning him to the leafy ground in a show of dominance ; they all froze when they saw me . \\n the pinned male twisted his head to stare at me , eyes entreating . \\n my heart thudded in my chest . \\n i knew those eyes . \\n i remembered them from school ; i remembered them from the local news . \\n `` jack ? '' \\n i whispered . \\n the pinned wolf whistled pitifully through his nostrils . \\n i just kept staring at those eyes . \\n hazel . \\n did wolves have hazel eyes ? \\n maybe they did . \\n why did they look so wrong ? \\n as i stared at them , that one word just kept singing through my head : human , human , human . \\n with a snarl in my direction , the she-wolf let him up . \\n she snapped at his side , pushing him away from me . \\n her eyes were on me the entire time , daring me to stop her , and something in me told me that maybe i should have tried . \\n but by the time my thoughts stopped spinning and i remembered the pocketknife in my jeans , the three wolves were already dark smudges in the distant trees . \\n without the wolf 's eyes before me , i had to wonder if i 'd imagined the likeness to jack 's . \\n after all , it had been two weeks since i 'd seen jack in person , and i 'd never really paid close attention to him . \\n i could have been misremembering his eyes . \\n what was i thinking , anyway ? \\n that he 'd turned into a wolf ? \\n i let out a deep breath . \\n actually , that was what i was thinking . \\n i did n't think i had forgotten jack 's eyes . \\n or his voice . \\n and i had n't imagined the human scream or the desperate howl . \\n i just knew it was jack , in the way i 'd known how to find my way through the trees . \\n there was a knot in my stomach . \\n nerves . \\n anticipation . \\n i did n't think jack was the only secret these woods held . \\n that night i lay in bed and stared at the window , my blinds pulled up so i could see the night sky . \\n one thousand brilliant stars punched holes in my consciousness , pricking me with longing . \\n i could stare at the stars for hours , their infinite number and depth pulling me into a part of myself that i ignored during the day . \\n outside , deep in the woods , i heard a long , keening wail , and then another , as the wolves began to howl . \\n more voices pitched in , some low and mournful , others high and short , an eerie and beautiful chorus . \\n i knew my wolf 's howl ; his rich tone sang out above the others as if begging me to hear it . \\n my heart ached inside me , torn between wanting them to stop and wishing they would go on forever . \\n i imagined myself there among them in the golden wood , watching them tilt their heads back and howl underneath a sky of endless stars . \\n i blinked a tear away , feeling foolish and miserable , but i did n't go to sleep until every wolf had fallen silent . \\n chapter ten grace 60of `` do you think we need to take the book home-you know , exploring guts , or whatever it 's called ? '' \\n i asked olivia . \\n `` for the reading ? \\n or can i leave it here ? '' \\n she shoved her locker shut , her arms full of books . \\n she was wearing reading glasses , complete with a chain on the ear pieces so that she could hang them around her neck . \\n on olivia , the look kind of worked , in a sort of charming librarian way . \\n `` it 's a lot of reading . \\n i 'm bringing it . '' \\n i reached back into my locker for the textbook . \\n behind us , the hall hummed with noise as students packed up and headed home . \\n all day long , i 'd tried to work up the nerve to tell olivia about the wolves . \\n normally i would n't have had to think about it , but after our almost-fight the day before , the moment had n't seemed to come up . \\n and now the day was over . \\n i took a deep breath . \\n `` i saw the wolves yesterday . '' \\n olivia paged idly through the book on top of her stack , not realizing how momentous my confession was . \\n `` which ones ? '' \\n `` the nasty she-wolf , the black one , and a new one . '' \\n i debated again whether or not to tell her . \\n she was way more interested in the wolves than rachel was , and i did n't know who else to talk to . \\n even inside my head , the words sounded crazy . \\n but since the evening before , the secret had surrounded me , tight around my chest and throat . \\n i let the words spill out , my voice low . \\n `` olivia , this is going to sound stupid . \\n the new wolf-i think something happened when the wolves attacked jack . '' \\n she just stared at me . \\n `` jack culpeper , '' i said . \\n `` i know who you meant . '' \\n olivia frowned at the front of her locker . \\n her knotted eyebrows were making me regret starting the conversation . \\n i sighed . \\n `` i thought i saw him in the woods . \\n jack . \\n as a. . . '' \\n i hesitated . \\n `` wolf ? '' \\n olivia clicked her heels together-i 'd never known anyone to actually do that , outside of the wizard of oz-and spun on them to face me with a raised eyebrow . \\n `` you 're crazy . '' \\n i could barely hear her over the students pressed all around us in the hall . \\n `` i mean , it 's a nice fantasy , and i can see why you 'd want to believe it-but you 're crazy . \\n sorry . '' \\n i leaned in close , although the hall was so loud that even i had to struggle to hear our conversation . \\n `` olive , i know what i saw . \\n they were jack 's eyes . \\n it was his voice . '' \\n of course , her doubt made me doubt , but i was n't about to admit that . \\n `` i think the wolves turned him into one of them . \\n wait-what do you mean ? \\n about me wanting to believe it ? '' \\n olivia gave me a long look before setting off toward our homeroom . \\n `` grace , seriously . \\n do n't think i do n't know what this is about . '' \\n `` what is this about ? '' \\n she answered with another question . \\n `` are they all were-wolves then ? '' \\n `` what ? \\n the whole pack ? \\n i do n't know . \\n i did n't think about that . '' \\n it had n't occurred to me . \\n it should have , but it had n't . \\n it was impossible . \\n that those long absences were because my wolf vanished into human form ? \\n the idea was immediately unbearable , only because i wanted it to be true so badly that it hurt . \\n `` yeah , sure you did n't . \\n do n't you think this obsession is getting kind of creepy , grace ? '' \\n my reply sounded more defensive than i meant it to . \\n `` i 'm not obsessed . '' \\n students shot annoyed looks at us as olivia stopped in the hall and put a finger on her chin . \\n `` hmm , it 's all you think about , all you talk about , and all you want us to talk about . \\n what in the world would we call something like that ? \\n oh , yeah ! \\n an obsession ! '' \\n `` i 'm just interested , '' i snapped . \\n `` and i thought you were , too . '' \\n `` i am interested in them . \\n just not like all-consuming , involving , whatever , interested . \\n i do n't fantasize about being one . '' \\n her eyes were narrowed behind her reading glasses . \\n `` we 're not thirteen anymore , but you have n't seemed to figure that out yet . '' \\n i did n't say anything . \\n all i could think was that she was being tremendously unfair , but i did n't feel like telling her that . \\n i did n't want to say anything to her . \\n i wanted to walk away and leave her standing there in the hallway . \\n but i did n't . \\n instead , i kept my voice super flat and even . \\n `` sorry to have bored you for so long . \\n must 've killed you to look entertained . '' \\n olivia grimaced . \\n `` seriously , grace . \\n i 'm not trying to be a jerk . \\n but you 're being impossible . '' \\n `` no , you 're just telling me that i 'm creepy obsessed with something that 's important to me . \\n that 's very '' - the word i wanted took too long to surface in my head and ruined the effect - `` philanthropic of you . \\n thanks for the help . '' \\n `` oh , grow up , '' snapped olivia , and pushed around me . \\n the hallway seemed too quiet after she 'd gone , and my cheeks felt hot . \\n instead of heading home , i trailed back into my empty homeroom , flopped into a chair , and put my head in my hands . \\n i could n't remember the last time i 'd fought with olivia . \\n i 'd looked at every photograph she 'd ever taken . \\n i 'd listened to countless rants about her family and the pressure to perform . \\n she owed it to me to at least hear me out . \\n my thoughts were cut short by the sound of cork heels squelching into the room . \\n the scent of expensive perfume hit me a second before i lifted my eyes to isabel culpeper standing over my desk . \\n `` i heard that you guys were talking about the wolves yesterday with that cop . '' \\n isabel 's voice was pleasant , but the expression in her eyes belied her tone . \\n the sympathy conjured up by her presence vanished at her words . \\n `` i 'm giving you the benefit of the doubt and assuming you 're innocently misinformed and not out-and-out retarded . \\n i heard you 're telling people the wolves are n't a problem . \\n you must not have heard the newsflash : those animals killed my brother . '' \\n `` i 'm sorry about jack , '' i said , automatically wanting to jump to my wolf 's defense . \\n for a second , i thought about jack 's eyes and what a revelation like that might mean to isabel , but i discounted the idea almost immediately . \\n if olivia thought i was crazy for believing in werewolves , isabel would probably be on the phone to the local mental institution before i could even finish a sentence . \\n `` shut . \\n up , '' isabel interrupted my thoughts . \\n `` i know you 're about to tell me the wolves are n't dangerous . \\n well , obviously they are . \\n and obviously , someone 's going to have to do something about that . '' \\n my mind flicked to the conversation in the classroom : tom culpeper and his stuffed animals . \\n i imagined my wolf , stuffed and glassy-eyed . \\n `` you do n't know that the wolves did it . \\n he could 've been - '' i stopped . \\n i knew the wolves had done it . \\n `` look , something went really wrong . \\n but it could 've been just one wolf . \\n the odds are that the rest of the pack had nothing to do with - '' `` how beautiful objectivity is , '' isabel snapped . \\n she just looked at me for a long moment . \\n long enough for me to wonder what it was she was thinking . \\n and then she said , `` seriously . \\n just get the last of your greenpeace wolf-love done soon , because they wo n't be around much longer , whether you like it or not . '' \\n my voice was tight . \\n `` why are you telling me this ? '' \\n `` i 'm sick of you telling people they 're harmless . \\n they killed him . \\n but you know what ? \\n it 's over now . \\n today . '' \\n isabel tapped my desk . \\n `` ta . '' \\n i grabbed her wrist before she could go ; i had a handful of fat bracelets . \\n `` what 's that supposed to mean ? '' \\n isabel stared at my hand on her wrist but did n't pull it away . \\n she 'd wanted me to ask . \\n `` what happened to jack is never happening again . \\n they 're killing the wolves . \\n today . \\n now . '' \\n she slipped out of my now-slack grip and glided through the door . \\n for a single moment , i sat at the desk , my cheeks burning , pulling her words apart and putting them back together again . \\n and then i jumped from my chair , my notes fluttering to the floor like listless birds . \\n i left them where they fell and ran for my car . \\n i was breathless by the time i slid behind the wheel of my car , isabel 's words playing over and over again in my head . \\n i 'd never thought of the wolves as vulnerable , but once i started imagining what a small-town attorney and big-time egomaniac like tom culpeper was capable of-fueled by pent-up anger and grief , helped along by wealth and influence-they suddenly seemed terribly fragile . \\n i shoved my key in the ignition , feeling the car rattle reluctantly to life as i did . \\n my eyes were on the yellow line of school buses waiting at the curb and the knots of loud students still milling on the sidewalk , but my brain was picturing the chalkwhite lines of the birches behind my house . \\n was a hunting party going after the wolves ? \\n hunting them now ? \\n i had to get home . \\n my car stalled , my foot uncertain on the dodgy clutch . \\n `` god , '' i said , glancing around to see how many people had seen my car gasp to a halt . \\n it was n't as if it were difficult to stall my car these days , now that the heat sensor was crapping out , but usually i could finesse the clutch and get on the road without too much humiliation . \\n i bit my lip , pulled myself together , and managed to restart . \\n there were two ways to get home from the school . \\n one was shorter but involved stoplights and stop signs-impossible today , when i was too distracted to baby my car . \\n i did n't have time to sit by the side of the road . \\n the other route was slightly longer , but with only two stop signs . \\n plus , it ran along the edge of boundary wood , where the wolves lived . \\n as i drove , pushing my car as hard as i dared , my stomach twisted , sick with nerves . \\n the engine gave an unhealthy shudder . \\n i checked the dials ; the engine was starting to overheat . \\n stupid car . \\n if only my father had taken me to the dealership like he kept promising he would . \\n as the sky began to burn brilliantly red on the horizon , turning the thin clouds to streaks of blood above the trees , my heart thumped in my ears , and my skin felt tingly , electric . \\n everything inside me screamed that something was wrong . \\n i did n't know what bothered me most-the nerves that shook my hands or the urge to curl my lips and fight . \\n up ahead , i spotted a line of pickup trucks parked by the side of the road . \\n their four-ways blinked in the failing light , sporadically illuminating the woods next to the road . \\n a figure leaned over the truck at the back of the line , holding something i could n't quite make out at this distance . \\n my stomach turned over again , and as i eased off the gas , my car gasped and stalled , leaving me coasting in an eerie quiet . \\n i turned the key , but between my jittery hands and the redlining heat sensor , the engine just shuddered under the hood without turning over . \\n i wished i 'd just gone to the dealership myself . \\n i had dad 's checkbook . \\n growling under my breath , i braked and let the car drift to a stop behind the pickup trucks . \\n i called mom 's studio on my cell , but there was no answer-she must have been at her gallery opening already . \\n i was n't really worried about getting home ; it was close enough to walk . \\n what i was worried about was those trucks . \\n because they meant that isabel had been telling the truth . \\n as i climbed out onto the shoulder of the road , i recognized the guy standing next to the pickup ahead . \\n it was officer koenig , out of uniform , drumming his fingers on the hood . \\n when i got closer , my stomach still churning , he looked up and his fingers stilled . \\n he was wearing a bright orange cap and held a shotgun in the crook of his arm . \\n `` car problems ? '' \\n he asked . \\n i turned abruptly at the sound of a car door slamming behind me . \\n another truck had pulled up , and two orangecapped hunters were making their way down the side of the road . \\n i looked past them , to where they were heading , and my breath caught in my throat . \\n dozens of hunters were knotted on the shoulder , all carrying rifles , visibly restless , voices muffled . \\n squinting into the dim trees beyond a shallow ditch , i could see more orange caps dotting the woods , infesting them . \\n the hunt had already begun . \\n i turned back to koenig and pointed at the gun he held . \\n `` is that for the wolves ? '' \\n koenig looked at it as if he 'd somehow forgotten it was there . \\n `` it 's - '' there was a loud crack from the woods behind him ; both of us jerked at the sound . \\n cheers rose from the group down the road . \\n `` what was that ? '' \\n i demanded . \\n but i knew what it was . \\n it was a gunshot . \\n in boundary wood . \\n my voice was steady , which surprised me . \\n `` they 're hunting the wolves , are n't they ? '' \\n `` with all due respect , miss , '' koenig said , `` i think you should wait in your car . \\n i can give you a ride home , but you 'll have to wait a little bit . '' \\n there were shouts in the woods , distant , and another popping sound , farther away . \\n god . \\n the wolves . \\n my wolf . \\n i grabbed koenig 's arm . \\n `` you have to tell them to stop ! \\n they ca n't shoot back there ! '' \\n koenig stepped back , pulling his arm from my grip . \\n `` miss - '' there was another distant pop , small and insignificant sounding . \\n in my head , i saw a perfect image of a wolf rolling , rolling , a gaping hole in its side , eyes dead . \\n i did n't think . \\n the words just came out . \\n `` your phone . \\n you have to call them and tell them to stop . \\n i have a friend in there ! \\n she was going to take photos this afternoon . \\n in the woods . \\n please , you have to call them ! '' \\n `` what ? '' \\n koenig froze . \\n `` there 's someone in there ? \\n are you sure ? '' \\n `` yes , '' i said , because i was sure . \\n `` please . \\n call them ! '' \\n god bless humorless officer koenig , because he did n't ask me for any more details . \\n pulling his cell phone from his pocket , he punched a quick number and held the phone to his ear . \\n his eyebrows made a straight , hard line , and after a second , he pulled the phone away and stared at the screen . \\n `` reception , '' he muttered , and tried again . \\n i stood by the pickup truck , my arms crossed over my chest as cold seeped into me , watching the gray dusk take over the road as the sun disappeared behind the trees . \\n surely they had to stop when it got dark . \\n but something told me that just because they had a cop standing watch by the road did n't make what they were doing legal . \\n staring at his phone again , koenig shook his head . \\n `` it 's not working . \\n hold on . \\n you know , it 'll be fine-they 're being careful-i 'm sure they would n't shoot a person . \\n but i 'll go and warn them . \\n let me lock my gun up . \\n it will only take a second . '' \\n as he started to put his shotgun in the pickup truck , there was another gunshot from the woods and something buckled inside me . \\n i just could n't wait anymore . \\n i jumped the ditch and scrambled up into the trees , leaving koenig behind . \\n i heard him calling after me , but i was already well into the woods . \\n i had to stop them-warn my wolf-do something . \\n but as i ran , slipping between trees and jumping over fallen limbs , all i could think was i 'm too late . \\n chapter eleven sam 50of we ran . \\n we were silent , dark drops of water , rushing over brambles and around the trees as the men drove us before them . \\n the woods i knew , the woods that protected me , were punched through by their sharp odors and their shouts . \\n i scrambled here and there amongst the other wolves , guiding and following , keeping us together . \\n the fallen trees and underbrush felt unfamiliar beneath my feet ; i kept from stumbling by flying-long , endless leaps , barely touching the ground . \\n it was terrifying to not know where i was . \\n we traded simple images amongst ourselves in our wordless , futile language : dark figures behind us , figures topped with bright warnings ; motionless , cold wolves ; the smell of death in our nostrils . \\n a crack deafened me , shook me out of balance . \\n beside me , i heard a whimper . \\n i knew which wolf it was without turning my head . \\n there was no time to stop ; nothing to do even if i had . \\n a new smell hit my nostrils : earthy rot and stagnant water . \\n the lake . \\n they were driving us to the lake . \\n i formed a clear image in my head at the same time that paul , the pack leader , did . \\n the slow , rippling edge of the water , thin pines growing sparsely in the poor soil , the lake stretching forever in both directions . \\n a pack of wolves , huddled on the shore . \\n no escape . \\n we were the hunted . \\n we slid before them , ghosts in the woods , and we fell , whether or not we fought . \\n the others kept running , toward the lake . \\n but i stopped . \\n chapter twelve grace 49of these were not the woods that i 'd walked through just a few days earlier , painted all the vivid hues of autumn . \\n these were close woods made of a thousand dark tree trunks turned black by dusk . \\n the sixth sense i 'd imagined guiding me before was gone ; all the familiar paths destroyed by crashing hunters in orange caps . \\n i was completely disoriented ; i had to keep stopping to listen for shouts and faraway footsteps through the dry leaves . \\n my breath was burning my throat by the time i saw the first orange cap , glowing distantly out of the twilight . \\n i shouted , but the cap did n't even turn ; the figure was too far away to hear me . \\n and then i saw the others-orange dots scattered through the woods , all moving slowly , relentlessly , in the same direction . \\n making a lot of noise . \\n driving the wolves ahead of them . \\n `` stop ! '' \\n i shouted . \\n i was close enough to see the outline of the nearest hunter , shotgun in his hands . \\n i closed the distance between us , my legs protesting , stumbling a little because i was tired . \\n he stopped walking and turned , surprised , waiting until i approached . \\n i had to get very close to see his face ; it was so close to night in these trees . \\n his face , older and lined , seemed vaguely familiar to me , though i could n't remember where in town i 'd seen him before . \\n the hunter frowned a strange frown at me ; i thought he looked guilty , but i could 've been reading into it . \\n `` well , what are you doing here ? '' \\n i started to speak before realizing that i was so out of breath that i could hardly get the words out . \\n seconds ticked by as i struggled to find my voice . \\n `` you-have-to-stop . \\n i have a friend in the woods here . \\n she was going to take photographs . '' \\n he squinted at me , and then looked at the darkening woods . \\n `` now ? '' \\n `` yes , now ! '' \\n i said , trying not to snap . \\n i saw a black box at his waist-a walkie-talkie . \\n `` you 've got to call them and tell them to stop . \\n it 's almost dark . \\n how would they see her ? '' \\n the hunter stared at me for an agonizingly long moment before nodding . \\n he reached for his walkie-talkie and unstrapped it and lifted it up and brought it toward his mouth . \\n it felt like he was doing everything in slow motion . \\n `` hurry ! '' \\n anxiety shot through me , a physical pain . \\n the hunter clicked the button down on the walkie-talkie to speak . \\n and suddenly a volley of shots snapped and snarled , not far away . \\n not little pops , like they were from the roadside , but crackling fireworks , unmistakably gunshots . \\n my ears rang . \\n in a weird way , i felt totally objective , like i was standing outside my own body . \\n so i could feel that my knees were weak and trembling without knowing why , and i heard my heartbeat racing inside me , and i saw red trickling down behind my eyes , like a dream of crimson . \\n like a viciously clear nightmare of death . \\n there was such a convincing metallic taste in my mouth that i touched my lips , expecting blood . \\n but there was nothing . \\n no pain . \\n just the absence of feeling . \\n `` there 's someone in the woods , '' the hunter said into his walkie-talkie , as if he could n't see that part of me was dying . \\n my wolf . \\n my wolf . \\n i could n't think of anything but his eyes . \\n `` hey ! \\n miss. '' this voice was younger than the hunter 's , and the hand that took my shoulder was firm . \\n koenig said , `` what were you thinking , taking off like that ? \\n there are people with guns here . '' \\n before i could reply to that , koenig turned to the hunter . \\n `` and i heard those shots . \\n i 'm fairly sure everyone in mercyfalls heard those shots . \\n it 's one thing , doing this '' - he jerked a hand toward the gun in the hunter 's hands - `` and something else flaunting it . '' \\n i started to twist out from under koenig 's hand ; he tightened his fingers reflexively and then released me when he realized what he was doing . \\n `` you 're from the school . \\n what 's your name ? '' \\n `` grace brisbane . '' \\n recognition dawned on the hunter 's face . \\n `` lewis brisbane 's daughter ? '' \\n koenig looked at him . \\n `` the brisbanes have a house right over there . \\n on the edge of the woods . '' \\n the hunter pointed in the direction of home . \\n the house was invisible behind a black tangle of trees . \\n koenig seized upon this bit of information . \\n `` i 'll escort you back there and then come back to find out what 's going on with your friend . \\n ralph , use that thing to tell them to stop shooting things . '' \\n `` i do n't need an escort , '' i said , but koenig walked with me anyway , leaving ralph the hunter talking into his walkie-talkie . \\n the cold air was beginning to bite and prickle on my cheeks , the evening getting cold quickly as the sun disappeared . \\n i felt as frozen on the inside as i was on the outside . \\n i could still see the curtain of red falling over my eyes and hear the crackling gunfire . \\n i was so sure that my wolf had been there . \\n at the edge of the woods , i stopped , looking at the dark glass of the back door on the deck . \\n the entire house looked shadowed , unoccupied , and koenig sounded dubious as he said , `` do you need me to - '' `` i can make it back from here . \\n thanks . '' \\n he hesitated until i stepped into our yard , and then i heard him go crashing back the way we 'd come . \\n for a long moment , i stood in the silent twilight , listening to the faraway voices in the woods and the wind rattling the dry leaves in the trees above me . \\n and as i stood there in what i had thought was silence , i started to hear sounds that i had n't before . \\n the rustling of animals in the woods , turning over crisp leaves with their paws . \\n the distant roar of trucks on the highway . \\n the sound of fast , ragged breathing . \\n i froze . \\n i held my breath . \\n but the uneven gasps were n't mine . \\n i followed the sound , climbing cautiously onto the deck , painfully aware of the sound of each stair sighing beneath my weight . \\n i smelled him before i saw him , my heart instantly revving up into high gear . \\n my wolf . \\n then the motion detector light above the back door clicked on and flooded the porch with yellow light . \\n and there he was , half sitting , half lying against the glass back door . \\n my breath caught painfully in my throat as i moved still closer , hesitant . \\n his beautiful ruff was gone and he was naked , but i knew it was my wolf even before he opened his eyes . \\n his pale yellow eyes , so familiar , flicked open at the sound of my approach , but he did n't move . \\n red was smeared from his ear to his desperately human shoulders-deadly war paint . \\n i ca n't tell you how i knew it was him , but i never doubted it . \\n werewolves did n't exist . \\n despite telling olivia i 'd seen jack , i had n't really believed it . \\n not like this . \\n the breeze carried the smell to my nostrils again , grounding me . \\n blood . \\n i was wasting time . \\n i pulled out my keys and reached over the top of him to open the back door . \\n too late , i saw one of his hands reach out , snatching air , and he crashed inside the open door , leaving a smear of red on the glass . \\n `` i 'm sorry ! '' \\n i said . \\n i could n't tell if he 'd heard me . \\n stepping over him , i hurried into the kitchen , hitting light switches as i did . \\n i grabbed a wad of dishcloths from a drawer ; as i did , i noticed my dad 's car keys on the counter , hastily thrown next to a pile of papers from work . \\n so i could use dad 's car , if i had to . \\n i ran back to the door . \\n i was afraid the boy might 've disappeared while my back was turned , a figment of my imagination , but he had n't moved . \\n he lay half in and half out , shaking violently . \\n without thinking , i grabbed him under his armpits and dragged him far enough inside that i could shut the door . \\n in the light of the breakfast area , blood smearing a path across the floor , he seemed tremendously real . \\n i crouched swiftly . \\n my voice was barely a whisper . \\n `` what happened ? '' \\n i knew the answer , but i wanted to hear him speak . \\n his knuckles were white where his hand was pressed against his neck , brilliant red leaking around his fingers . \\n `` shot . '' \\n my stomach squeezed with nerves , not from what he said , but the voice that said it . \\n it was him . \\n human words , not a howl , but the timbre was the same . \\n it was him . \\n `` let me see . '' \\n i had to pry his hands away from his neck . \\n there was too much blood to see the wound , so i just pressed one of the dishcloths over the mess of red that stretched from his chin to his collarbone . \\n it was well beyond my first-aid abilities . \\n `` hold this . '' \\n his eyes flicked to me , familiar but subtly different . \\n the wildness was tempered with a comprehension that had been absent before . \\n `` i do n't want to go back . '' \\n the agony in his words immediately transported me to a memory : a wolf standing in silent grief before me . \\n the boy 's body jerked , a weird , unnatural movement that hurt to think about . \\n `` do n't - do n't let me change . '' \\n i laid a second , bigger dishcloth over his body , covering the goose bumps as best i could . \\n in any other context , i would 've been embarrassed by his nakedness , but here , his skin smeared with blood and dirt , it just made his condition seem more pitiful . \\n my words were gentle , as though he might still leap up and run . \\n `` what 's your name ? '' \\n he groaned softly , one hand shaking just a bit as he held the cloth against his neck . \\n it was already soaked through with his blood , and a thin red trail ran along his jaw and dripped to the floor . \\n lowering himself slowly to the floor , he laid his cheek against the wood , his breath clouding the shiny finish . \\n `` sam . '' \\n he closed his eyes . \\n `` sam , '' i repeated . \\n `` i 'm grace . \\n i 'm going to go start my dad 's car . \\n i have to take you to the hospital . '' \\n he shuddered . \\n i had to lean very close to hear his voice . \\n `` grace-grace , i - '' i only waited a second for him to finish . \\n when he did n't , i jumped up and grabbed the keys from the counter . \\n i still could n't quite believe that he was n't my own invention-years of wishing made real . \\n but whatever he was , he was here now , and i was n't about to lose him . \\n chapter thirteen sam 45of i was not a wolf , but i was n't sam yet , either . \\n i was a leaking womb bulging with the promise of conscious thoughts : the frozen woods far behind me , the girl on the tire swing , the sound of fingers on metal strings . \\n the future and the past , both the same , snow and then summer and then snow again . \\n a shattered spider 's web of many colors , cracked in ice , immeasurably sad . \\n `` sam , '' the girl said . \\n `` sam . '' \\n she was past present future . \\n i wanted to answer , but i was broken . \\n chapter fourteen grace 45of it 's rude to stare , but the great thing about staring at a sedated person is that they do n't know you 're doing it . \\n and the truth was , i could n't stop staring at sam . \\n if he 'd gone to my school , he probably would 've been dismissed as an emo kid or maybe a long-lost member of the beatles . \\n he had that sort of moptop black hair and interestingly shaped nose that a girl could never get away with . \\n he looked nothing like a wolf , but everything like my wolf . \\n even now , without his familiar eyes open , a little part of me kept jumping with irrational glee , reminding myself-it 's him . \\n `` oh , honey , are you still here ? \\n i thought you 'd left . '' \\n i turned as the green curtains parted to admit a broad-shouldered nurse . \\n her name tag read sunny . \\n `` i 'm staying until he wakes up . '' \\n i held on to the side of the hospital bed as if to prove how difficult it would be to remove me . \\n sunny smiled pityingly at me . \\n `` he 's been heavily sedated , hon. he wo n't wake up until the morning . '' \\n i smiled back at her , my voice firm . \\n `` then that 's how long i 'm staying . '' \\n i 'd already waited hours while they removed the bullet and stitched the wound ; it had to be after midnight by now . \\n i kept waiting to feel sleepy , but i was wired . \\n every time i saw him it was like another jolt . \\n it occurred to me , belatedly , that my parents had n't bothered to call my cell phone when they got back from mom 's gallery opening . \\n they probably had n't even noticed the bloody towel i 'd used to hurriedly wipe up the floor , or the fact that dad 's car was missing . \\n or maybe they just had n't gotten home yet . \\n midnight was early for them . \\n sunny 's smile stayed in place . \\n `` okay , then , '' she said . \\n `` you know , he 's awfully lucky . \\n for the bullet to just graze him ? '' \\n her eyes glittered . \\n `` do you know why he did it ? '' \\n i frowned at her , nerves prickling . \\n `` i do n't follow . \\n why he was in the woods ? '' \\n `` hon , you and i both know he was n't in the woods . '' \\n i raised an eyebrow , waiting for her to say something else , but she did n't . \\n i said , `` uh , yeah . \\n he was . \\n a hunter accidentally shot him . '' \\n it was n't a lie . \\n well , all but the `` accidentally '' part . \\n i was pretty confident it was no accident . \\n sunny clucked . \\n `` look-grace , is n't it ? \\n grace , are you his girlfriend ? '' \\n i grunted in a way that could be interpreted as either yes or no , depending on how the listener was leaning . \\n sunny took it as a yes . \\n `` i know you 're really close to the situation , but he does need help . '' \\n realization dawned on me . \\n i almost laughed . \\n `` you think he shot himself . \\n look-sunny , is n't it ? \\n sunny , you 're wrong . '' \\n the nurse glared at me . \\n `` do you think we 're stupid ? \\n that we would n't notice this ? '' \\n on the other side of the bed , she took sam 's limp arms and turned them so his palms faced toward the ceiling in a silent entreaty . \\n she gestured at the scars on his wrists , memories of deep , purposeful wounds that should 've been lethal . \\n i stared at them , but they were like words in a foreign language . \\n they meant nothing to me . \\n i shrugged . \\n `` those are from before i knew him . \\n i 'm just telling you he did n't try and shoot himself tonight . \\n it was some insane hunter . '' \\n `` sure , hon. fine . \\n let me know if you need anything . '' \\n sunny glared at me before backing out of the curtain and leaving me alone with sam . \\n face flushed , i shook my head and stared at my white-knuckled grip on the bed . \\n of all my pet peeves , condescending adults were probably at the top of the list . \\n a second after sunny was gone , sam 's eyes flicked open , and i jumped out of my skin , heart pounding in my ears . \\n it took a long moment of staring at him for my pulse to return to normal . \\n logic told me to read his eyes as hazel , but really , they were still yellow , and they were definitely fixed on me . \\n my voice came out a lot quieter than i meant it to . \\n `` you 're supposed to be asleep . '' \\n `` who are you ? '' \\n his voice had the same complicated , mournful tone i remembered from his howl . \\n he narrowed his eyes . \\n `` your voice seems so familiar . '' \\n pain flickered through me . \\n it had n't occurred to me that he might not remember his time as a wolf . \\n i did n't know what the rules were for this . \\n sam reached his hand toward mine , and i automatically put my fingers in his . \\n with a guilty little smile , he pulled my hand toward his nose and took a sniff , and then another one . \\n his smile widened , though it was still shy . \\n it was absolutely adorable , and my breath got caught somewhere in my throat . \\n `` i know that smell . \\n i did n't recognize you ; you look different . \\n i 'm sorry . \\n i feel stupid for not remembering . \\n it takes a couple hours for me-for my brain-to come back . '' \\n he did n't release my fingers , and i did n't take them away , even though it was hard to concentrate with his skin against mine . \\n `` come back from what ? '' \\n `` come back from when , '' he corrected . \\n `` come back from when i was ... '' sam waited . \\n he wanted me to say it . \\n it was harder than i thought it would be , to admit it out loud , even though it should n't have been . \\n `` when you were a wolf , '' i whispered . \\n `` why are you here ? '' \\n `` because i was shot , '' he said pleasantly . \\n `` i meant like this . '' \\n i gestured toward his body , so clearly human underneath the silly hospital gown . \\n he blinked . \\n `` oh . \\n because it 's spring . \\n because it 's warm . \\n warm makes me me . \\n makes me sam . '' \\n i finally pulled my hand away and closed my eyes , trying to gather what was left of my sanity for a moment . \\n when i opened my eyes and spoke , i said the most mundane thing possible . \\n `` it 's not spring . \\n it 's september . '' \\n i 'm not the best at reading people , but i thought i saw a glimmer of anxiety behind his eyes before they cleared . \\n `` that 's not good , '' he remarked . \\n `` can i ask you a favor ? '' \\n i had to close my eyes again at the sound of his voice , because it should n't have been familiar , but it was , speaking to me on some deep level just like his eyes always had as a wolf . \\n it was turning out to be more difficult to accept this than i 'd thought . \\n i opened my eyes . \\n he was still there . \\n i tried again , closing and then opening them once more . \\n but he was still there . \\n he laughed . \\n `` are you having an epileptic fit ? \\n maybe you should be in this bed . '' \\n i glared at him , and he turned bright red as he realized another meaning for his words . \\n i spared him from his mortification by answering his question . \\n `` what 's the favor ? '' \\n `` i , uh , need some clothing . \\n i need to get out of here before they figure out i 'm a freak . '' \\n `` how do you mean ? \\n i did n't see a tail . '' \\n sam reached up and began to pry at the edge of the dressings on his neck . \\n `` are you crazy ? '' \\n i reached forward and grabbed at his hand , too late . \\n he peeled away the gauze to reveal four new stitches dotting a short line through old scar tissue . \\n there was no fresh wound still oozing blood , no evidence of the gunshot except for the pink , shiny scar . \\n my jaw dropped . \\n sam smiled , clearly pleased by my reaction . \\n `` see , do n't you think they 'd suspect something ? '' \\n `` but there was so much blood - '' `` yeah . \\n my skin just could n't heal when it was bleeding so much . \\n once they stitched me up - '' he shrugged and made a little gesture with his hands , like he was opening a small book . \\n `` abracadabra . \\n there are some perks to being me . '' \\n his words were light , but his expression was anxious , watching me , seeing how i was taking all this . \\n how i was taking the fact of his existence . \\n `` okay , i just have to see something here , '' i told him . \\n `` i just - '' i stepped forward and touched the end of my fingers to the scar tissue on his neck . \\n somehow feeling the smooth , firm skin convinced me in a way that his words could n't . \\n sam 's eyes slid to my face and away again , unsure of where to look while i felt the lump of old scar beneath the prickling black sutures . \\n i let my hand linger on his neck for slightly longer than necessary , not on the scar , but on the smooth , wolf-scented skin beside it . \\n `` okay . \\n so obviously you need to leave before they look at it . \\n but if you sign out against medical advice or just take off , they 'll try to track you down . '' \\n he made a face . \\n `` no , they wo n't . \\n they 'll just figure i 'm some derelict without insurance . \\n which is true . \\n well , the insurance part . '' \\n so much for being subtle . \\n `` no , they 'll think you left to avoid counseling . \\n they think you shot yourself because of - '' sam 's face was puzzled . \\n i pointed to his wrists . \\n `` oh , that . \\n i did n't do that . '' \\n i frowned at him again . \\n i did n't want to say something like , `` it 's okay , you have an excuse '' or `` you can tell me , i wo n't judge , '' because , really , that 'd be just as bad as sunny , assuming that he 'd tried to kill himself . \\n but it was n't as though he could 've gotten those scars tripping on the stairs . \\n he rubbed a thumb over one of his wrists , thoughtful . \\n `` my mom did this one . \\n dad did the other one . \\n i remember they counted backward so they 'd do it at the same time . \\n i still ca n't stand to look at a bathtub . '' \\n it took me a moment to process what he meant . \\n i do n't know what did it-the flat , emotionless way he said it , the image of the scene that swam in my head , or just the shock of the evening in general , but i suddenly felt dizzy . \\n my head whirled , my heartbeat crashed in my ears , and i hit the sticky linoleum floor hard . \\n i do n't know how many seconds i was out , but i saw the curtain slide open at the same time that sam thumped back down on the bed , slapping the bandage back over his neck . \\n then a male nurse was kneeling beside me , helping me sit up . \\n `` are you okay ? '' \\n i 'd fainted . \\n i 'd never fainted in my life . \\n i closed my eyes and opened them again , until the nurse had one head instead of three heads floating side by side . \\n then i began to lie . \\n `` i just thought about all the blood when i found him ... ohhhh ... '' i still felt woozy , so the ohhhh sounded very convincing . \\n `` do n't think about it , '' suggested the nurse , smiling in a very friendly way . \\n i thought his hand was slightly too close to my boob for casual contact , and that fact steeled my resolve to follow through with the humiliating plan that had just popped into my head . \\n `` i think-i need to ask an embarrassing question , '' i muttered , feeling my cheeks heat . \\n this was almost as bad as if i was telling the truth . \\n `` do you think i could borrow a pair of scrubs ? \\n i-uh-my pants - '' `` oh ! '' \\n cried the poor nurse . \\n his embarrassment at my condition was probably sharpened by his earlier flirtatious smile . \\n `` yes . \\n absolutely . \\n i 'll be right back . '' \\n good as his word , he returned in a few minutes , holding a folded pair of sick-green scrubs in his hands . \\n `` they might be a little big , but they have strings that you can-you know . '' \\n `` thanks , '' i mumbled . \\n `` uh , do you mind ? \\n i 'll just change here . \\n he 's not looking at anything at the moment . '' \\n i gestured toward sam , who was looking convincingly sedated . \\n the nurse vanished behind the curtains . \\n sam 's eyes flashed open again , distinctly amused . \\n he whispered , `` did you tell that man you went potty on yourself ? '' \\n `` you . \\n shut . \\n up , '' i hissed back furiously and chucked the scrubs at his head . \\n `` hurry up before they find out i did n't wet myself . \\n you seriously owe me . '' \\n he grinned and slid the scrubs beneath the thin hospital sheet , wrestling them on , then tugged the dressing from his neck and the blood pressure cuff from his arm . \\n as the cuff dropped to the bed , he ripped off his gown and replaced it with the scrubs top . \\n the monitor squealed in protest , flatlining and announcing his death to the staff . \\n `` time to go , '' he said , and led the way out behind the curtains . \\n as he paused , quickly taking in the room around us , i heard nurses rustling into his curtained area behind us . \\n `` he was sedated . '' \\n sunny 's voice rose above the others . \\n sam reached out and grabbed my hand , the most natural thing in the world , and pulled me into the bright light of the hall . \\n now that he was clothed-in scrubs , no less-and not drowning in blood , nobody blinked an eye as he wended his way past the nurses ' station and on toward the exit . \\n all the while , i could see his wolf 's mind analyzing the situation . \\n the tilt of his head told me what he was listening to , and the lift of his chin hinted of the scents he was gathering . \\n agile despite his lanky , loose-jointed build , he cut a deft path through the clutter until we were crossing the general lobby . \\n a syrupy country song was playing over the speaker system as my sneakers scrubbed across the ugly dark-blue tartan carpet ; sam 's bare feet made no sound . \\n at this time of night , the lobby was empty , without even a receptionist at the desk . \\n i felt so high on adrenaline i thought i could probably fly to dad 's car . \\n the eternally pragmatic corner of my mind reminded me that i needed to call the tow company to get my own car off the side of the road . \\n but i could n't really work up proper annoyance about it , because all i could think about was sam . \\n my wolf was a cute guy and he was holding my hand . \\n i could die happy . \\n then i felt sam 's hesitation . \\n he held back , eyes fixed on the darkness that pressed against the glass door . \\n `` how cold is it out there ? '' \\n `` probably not too much colder than it was when i brought you . \\n why-will it make that much of a difference ? '' \\n sam 's face darkened . \\n `` it 's right on the edge . \\n i hate this time of year . \\n i could be either . '' \\n i heard the pain in his voice . \\n `` does it hurt to change ? '' \\n he looked away from me . \\n `` i want to be human right now . '' \\n i wanted him to be human , too . \\n `` i 'll go start the car and get the heater going . \\n that way you 'll only be in the cold for a second . '' \\n he looked a little helpless . \\n `` but i do n't know where to go . '' \\n `` where do you normally live ? '' \\n i was afraid he 'd say something pitiful , like the homeless shelter downtown . \\n i assumed he did n't live with the parents who had cut his wrists . \\n `` beck-one of the wolves-once he changes , a lot of us stay at his house , but if he 's not changed , the heat might not be turned up . \\n i could - '' i shook my head and let go of his hand . \\n `` no . \\n i 'm getting the car and you 're coming home with me . '' \\n his eyes widened . \\n `` your parents - ? '' \\n `` what they do n't know wo n't kill them , '' i said , pushing open the door . \\n wincing at the blast of cold night air , sam backed away from the door , wrapping his arms around himself . \\n but even as he shuddered with the cold , he bit his lip and gave me a hesitant smile . \\n i turned toward the dark parking lot , feeling more alive and more happy and more afraid than i ever had before . \\n chapter fifteen grace 43of `` are you sleeping ? '' \\n sam 's voice was barely a whisper , but in the dark room where he did n't belong , it was like a shout . \\n i rolled in my bed toward where he lay on the floor , a dark bundle curled in a nest of blankets and pillows . \\n his presence , so strange and wonderful , seemed to fill the room and press against me . \\n i did n't think i 'd ever sleep again . \\n `` no . '' \\n `` can i ask you a question ? '' \\n `` you already have . '' \\n he paused , considering . \\n `` can i ask you two questions , then ? '' \\n `` you already have . '' \\n sam groaned and threw one of the small sofa pillows in my direction . \\n it arced through the moonlit room , a blackened projectile , and thumped harmlessly by my head . \\n `` so you 're a smart-ass , then . '' \\n i grinned in the darkness . \\n `` okay , i 'll play . \\n what do you want to know ? '' \\n `` you were bitten . '' \\n but it was n't a question . \\n i could hear the interest in his voice , sense the tension in his body , even across the room . \\n i slid down into my blankets , hiding from what he 'd said . \\n `` i do n't know . '' \\n sam 's voice rose above a whisper . \\n `` how can you not know ? '' \\n i shrugged , though he could n't see it . \\n `` i was young . '' \\n `` i was young , too . \\n i knew what was happening . '' \\n when i did n't answer , he asked , `` is that why you just lay there ? \\n you did n't know they were going to kill you ? '' \\n i stared at the dark square of night through the window , lost in the memory of sam as a wolf . \\n the pack circled around me , tongues and teeth , growls and jerks . \\n one wolf stood back , ice-decked ruff bristling all along his neck , quivering as he watched me in the snow . \\n lying in the cold , under a white sky going dark , i kept my eyes on him . \\n he was beautiful : wild and dark , yellow eyes filled with a complexity i could n't begin to fathom . \\n and he gave off a scent the same as the other wolves around me-rich , feral , musky . \\n even now , as he lay in my room , i could smell the wolf on him , though he was wearing scrubs and a new skin . \\n outside , i heard a low , keening howl , and then another . \\n the night chorus rose , missing sam 's plaintive voice but gorgeous nonetheless . \\n my heart quickened , sick with abstract longing , and on the floor , i heard sam give a low whimper . \\n the miserable sound , caught halfway between human and wolf , distracted me . \\n `` do you miss them ? '' \\n i whispered . \\n sam climbed from his makeshift bed and stood by the window , an unfamiliar silhouette against the night , his arms clutched around his lanky body . \\n `` no . \\n yeah . \\n i do n't know . \\n it makes me feel-sick . \\n like i do n't belong here . '' \\n sounds familiar . \\n i tried to think of something to say to comfort him , but could n't settle on anything that would sound genuine . \\n `` but this is me , '' he insisted , his chin jerking to refer to his body . \\n i did n't know if he meant to convince me or himself . \\n he remained by the window as the wolves ' howls reached a crescendo , pricking my eyes to tears . \\n `` come up here and talk to me , '' i said , to distract both of us . \\n sam half turned , but i could n't see his expression . \\n `` it 's cold down there on the floor and you 'll get a crick in your neck . \\n just come up here . '' \\n `` what about your parents ? '' \\n he said , the same question he 'd asked in the hospital . \\n i was about to ask him why he worried about them so much , when i remembered sam 's story about his own parents and the shiny , puckered scars on his wrists . \\n `` you do n't know my parents . '' \\n `` where are they ? '' \\n sam asked . \\n `` gallery opening , i think . \\n my mom 's an artist . '' \\n his voice was dubious . \\n `` it 's three o'clock in the morning . '' \\n my voice was louder than i 'd meant for it to be . \\n `` just get in . \\n i trust you to behave . \\n and to not hog the sheets . '' \\n when he still hesitated , i said , `` hurry up , before there 's no more night left . '' \\n obediently , he retrieved one of the pillows from the floor , but hesitated again on the opposite side of the bed . \\n in the dim light , i could just make out his mournful expression as he regarded the forbidden territory of the bed . \\n i was n't sure if i was charmed by his reluctance to share a bed with a girl or insulted that , apparently , i was n't hot enough for him to charge the mattress like a bull . \\n finally , he climbed in . \\n the bed creaked under his weight , and he winced before settling on the very far edge of it , not even under the blanket . \\n i could smell the faint wolf scent better now , and i sighed with a strange contentedness . \\n he sighed , too . \\n `` thank you , '' he said . \\n formal , considering he was lying in my bed . \\n `` you 're welcome . '' \\n the truth of it struck me then . \\n here i was with a shapeshifting boy in my bed . \\n not just any shape-shifting boy , but my wolf . \\n i kept reliving the memory of the deck light clicking to life , revealing him for the first time . \\n a weird combination of excitement and nervousness tingled through me . \\n sam turned his head to look at me , as though my thrill of nerves had sent up a flare . \\n i could see his eyes glinting in the dim light , a few feet away . \\n `` they bit you . \\n you should 've changed , too , you know . '' \\n in my head , the wolves circled a body in the snow , their lips bloody , teeth bared , growling over the kill . \\n a wolf , sam , dragged the body from the circle of wolves . \\n he carried it through the trees on two legs that left human footprints in the snow . \\n i knew i was falling asleep , so i shook myself awake ; i could n't remember whether i 'd answered sam . \\n `` sometimes i wish i had , '' i told him . \\n he closed his eyes , miles away on the other side of the bed . \\n `` sometimes i do , too . '' \\n chapter sixteen sam 42of i woke up all in a rush . \\n for a moment , i lay still , blinking , trying to determine what had woken me . \\n the events of the previous night rushed back to me as i realized it was n't a sound that had woken me , but a sensation : a hand resting on my arm . \\n grace had rolled over in her sleep , and i could n't stop staring at her fingers resting on my skin . \\n here , lying next to the girl who had rescued me , my simple humanity felt like a triumph . \\n i rolled onto my side and for a while , i just watched her sleep , long , even breaths that moved the flyaway hairs by her face . \\n in slumber , she seemed utterly certain of her safety , utterly unconcerned by my presence beside her . \\n that felt like a subtle victory , too . \\n when i heard her father get up , i lay perfectly still , heart beating fast and silent , ready to leap from the edge of the mattress in case he came to wake her for school . \\n but he left for work in a cloud of juniper-scented aftershave that billowed toward me from under the door . \\n her mother left soon after , noisily dropping something in the kitchen and swearing in a pleasant voice as she shut the door behind her . \\n i could n't believe they would n't glance into grace 's room to make sure she was still alive , especially considering they had n't seen her when they came home in the dead of the night . \\n but the door stayed shut . \\n anyway , i felt foolish in the scrubs , and they were useless to me in this awful in-between weather , so i slipped out while grace slept ; she did n't even stir as i left . \\n i hesitated on the back deck , looking at the frost-tipped blades of grass . \\n even though i 'd borrowed a pair of her father 's boots , the early morning air still bit at the skin of my bare ankles beneath the rubber . \\n i could almost feel the nausea of the change rolling over in my stomach . \\n sam , i told myself , willing my body to believe . \\n you 're sam . \\n i needed to be warmer ; i retreated inside to find a coat . \\n damn this weather . \\n what had happened to summer ? \\n in an overstuffed closet that smelled of stale memories and mothballs , i found a puffy , bright blue jacket that made me look like a blimp and ventured out into the backyard with more confidence . \\n grace 's father had feet the size of a yeti , so i tramped into the woods with all the grace of a polar bear in a dollhouse . \\n despite the chilly air that made ghosts of my breath , the woods were beautiful this time of year , all bold primary colors : crisp leaves in startling yellow and red , bright cerulean sky . \\n details i never noticed as a wolf . \\n but as i made my way toward my stash of clothing , i missed all the things i did n't notice as a human . \\n though i still had heightened senses , i could n't smell the many subtle tracks of animals in the underbrush or the damp promise of warmer weather later in the day . \\n normally , i could hear the industrial symphony of cars and trucks on the distant highway and detect the size and speed of each vehicle . \\n but now all i could smell was the smokiness of autumn , its burning leaves and half-dead trees , and all i could hear was the low , barely audible hum of traffic far in the distance . \\n as a wolf , i would have smelled shelby 's approach long before she 'd come into sight . \\n but not now . \\n she was nearly on top of me when i got the feeling that something was close . \\n the tiny hairs on my neck stood at attention , and i had the uneasy sense that i was sharing my breath with someone else . \\n i turned and saw her , big for a female , white coat ordinary and yellowish in this full daylight . \\n she seemed to have survived the hunt without so much as a scratch . \\n ears slightly back , she observed my ridiculous apparel with a cocked head . \\n `` shhh , '' i said , and held my hand out , palm up , letting what was left of my scent waft toward her . \\n `` it 's me . '' \\n her muzzle curled in distaste as she backed slowly away , and i guessed she recognized grace 's scent layered on top of mine . \\n i knew i did ; even now , her spare , soapy aroma clung to my hair where i 'd lain on her bed and to my hand where she 'd held it . \\n wariness flashed in shelby 's eyes , mirroring her human expression . \\n this was how it was with shelby and me-i could n't remember a time we had n't been subtly at odds . \\n i clung to my humanity-and to my obsession with grace-like a drowning man , but shelby welcomed the forgetting that came with her lupine skin . \\n of course , she had plenty of reasons to forget . \\n now , in these september woods , we regarded each other . \\n her ears tipped toward me and away , collecting dozens of sounds that escaped my human ears , and her nostrils worked , discovering where i 'd been . \\n i found myself remembering the sensation of dried leaves beneath my paws and the sharp , rich , slumber-heavy scent of these autumn woods when i was a wolf . \\n shelby stared into my eyes-a very human gesture , considering my rank in the pack was too high for wolves other than paul or beck to challenge me like that-and i imagined her human voice saying to me , as it had so many times before , do n't you miss it ? \\n i closed my eyes , shutting out the vividness of her gaze and the memory of my wolf body , and instead thought of grace , back at the house . \\n there was nothing in my wolf experience that could ever compare to the feeling of grace 's hand in mine . \\n i immediately turned this thought over in my head , creating lyrics . \\n you 're my change of skin / my summer-winter-fall / i spring to follow you / this loss is beautiful . \\n in the second it took me to compose the lyric and imagine the guitar riff that would go with it , shelby had vanished into the woods , soft as a whisper . \\n that she could disappear with the same silent stealth as she had arrived reminded me of my vulnerable state , and i clumped hurriedly to the shed where my clothing was stashed . \\n years ago , beck and i had dragged the old shed , piece by piece , from his backyard to a small clearing deep in the woods . \\n inside were a space heater , a boat battery , and several plastic bins with names written on the sides . \\n i opened the bin marked with my name and pulled out the stuffed backpack inside . \\n the other bins were loaded with food and blankets and spare batteries-equipment for holing up in this shack , waiting for other pack members to change-but mine contained supplies for escape . \\n everything i kept here was designed to get me back to humanity as quickly as possible , and for that , shelby could n't forgive me . \\n i hurriedly changed into my several layers of long-sleeved shirts and a pair of jeans and traded grace 's father 's oversized boots for wool socks and my scuffed leather shoes , getting my wallet with my summer-job money in it and stuffing everything left over into the backpack . \\n as i shut the shed door behind me , i caught dark movement out of the corner of my eye . \\n `` paul , '' i said , but the black wolf , our wolf pack leader , was gone . \\n i doubted he even knew me now : to him , i was just another human in these woods , despite my vaguely familiar scent . \\n the knowledge prickled a kind of regret somewhere in the back of my throat . \\n last year , paul had n't become human until the end of august . \\n maybe he would n't change at all this year . \\n i knew my own remaining shifts were numbered , too . \\n last year i had changed in june , a frighteningly huge jump from the previous year 's shift in early spring , when there had still been snow on the ground . \\n and this year ? \\n how late would i have gotten my body back if tom culpeper had n't shot me ? \\n i did n't even really understand how being shot had given me back my human form in this cool weather . \\n i thought of how frigid it had been when grace knelt over me , pressing a cloth to my neck . \\n it had n't been summer for a long time . \\n the brilliant colors of the brittle leaves all around the shed mocked me then , evidence that a year had lived and died without my being aware of it . \\n i knew with sudden , chilling certainty that this was my last year . \\n to meet grace only now seemed like an intensely cruel twist of fate . \\n i did n't want to think about it . \\n instead , i jogged back to the house , checking to make sure that grace 's parents ' cars were still gone . \\n letting myself back in , i hovered outside the bedroom door for a second , then loitered for a long time in the kitchen , looking through the cabinets even though i was n't really hungry . \\n admit it . \\n you 're too nervous to go back in there . \\n i wanted so badly to see her again , this iron-willed ghost that had haunted my years in the woods . \\n but i was afraid , too , of how seeing her face-to-face in damning daylight might change things . \\n or worse , would n't change things . \\n last night , i 'd been bleeding to death on her back deck . \\n anyone might have saved me . \\n today , i wanted more than saving . \\n but what if i was just a freak to her ? \\n you 're an abomination to god 's creation . \\n you 're cursed . \\n you 're the devil . \\n where is my son ? \\n what have you done with him ? \\n i closed my eyes , wondering why , considering all the things i had lost , memories of my parents could n't have been among them . \\n `` sam ? '' \\n i jerked , hearing my name . \\n grace called again in her room , barely above a whisper , wondering where i was . \\n she did n't sound afraid . \\n i pushed open her door and looked around her room . \\n in the strong late-morning light , i could see now that it was a grown - up 's room . \\n no leftover pink whimsy or stuffed animals for grace , if she 'd ever had them . \\n framed photographs of trees on the walls , all matching black frames with no frills . \\n matching black furniture , all very square and useful looking . \\n her towel and washcloth tidily folded on top of the dresser next to another clock-black-and-white , all smooth lines-and a stack of library books , mostly narrative nonfiction and mysteries , judging by the titles . \\n probably alphabetized or organized according to length . \\n i was suddenly struck by how dissimilar we were . \\n it occurred to me that if grace and i were objects , she would be an elaborate digital clock , synced up with the world clock in london with technical perfection , and i 'd be a snow globe-shaken memories in a glass ball . \\n i struggled to find something to say that would n't sound like the greeting of an interspecies stalker . \\n `` good morning , '' i managed . \\n grace sat up , her hair frizzy on one side and flat against her head on the other , her dark eyes filled with open delight . \\n `` you 're still here ! \\n oh . \\n you have clothes . \\n i mean , instead of scrubs . '' \\n `` i went to get them while you were sleeping . '' \\n `` what time is it ? \\n ohhh-i 'm really late for school , are n't i ? '' \\n `` it 's eleven . '' \\n grace groaned and then shrugged . \\n `` you know what ? \\n i have n't missed class since i started high school . \\n i got an award for it last year . \\n and a free pizza or something . '' \\n she climbed out of bed ; in the daylight , i could see just how clingy and unbearably sexy her camisole top was . \\n i turned away . \\n `` you do n't have to be so chaste , you know . \\n it 's not like i 'm naked . '' \\n pausing in front of her closet , she looked back at me , her expression canny . \\n `` you have n't seen me naked , have you ? '' \\n `` no ! '' \\n my answer came out distinctly rushed . \\n she grinned at my lie and pulled some jeans from the closet floor . \\n `` well , unless you want to see me now , you 'd better turn around . '' \\n i lay down on the bed , face buried in the cool pillows that smelled of her . \\n i listened to the rustling sounds she made as she pulled on her clothing , my heart pounding a million miles an hour . \\n i sighed , guilty , unable to contain the lie . \\n `` i did n't mean to . '' \\n the mattress groaned as she crashed onto it , her face close to mine . \\n `` are you always this apologetic ? '' \\n my voice was muffled by her pillow . \\n `` i 'm trying to make you think i 'm a decent person . \\n telling you i saw you na ** d while i was another species does not help my case . '' \\n she laughed . \\n `` i 'll grant you leniency , since i should 've pulled the blinds . '' \\n there was a long silence , filled with a thousand unspoken messages . \\n i could smell her nervousness , faintly wafting from her skin , and could hear the fast beat of her heart carried through the mattress to my ear . \\n it would have been so easy for my lips to span the inches between our mouths . \\n i thought i could hear the hope in her heartbeat : kiss me kiss me kiss me . \\n normally i was good at sensing others ' feelings , but with grace , everything i thought i knew was clouded by what i wanted . \\n she giggled quietly ; it was a terribly cute noise , and also completely at odds with how i normally thought of her . \\n `` i 'm starving , '' she said finally . \\n `` let 's go find breakfast . \\n or brunch , i guess . '' \\n i rolled out of bed and she rolled after me . \\n i was acutely aware of her hands on my back , pushing me through the bedroom door . \\n together we padded softly out into the kitchen . \\n sunlight , too bright , blared in the glass door to the deck , reflecting off the white counter and tile in the kitchen , covering us both with white light . \\n because of my previous exploration , i knew where things were , so i started to take out supplies . \\n as i moved about the kitchen , grace shadowed me , her fingers finding my elbow and her palm brushing along my back , finding excuses to touch me . \\n out of the corner of my eye , i could see her staring unabashedly at me when she thought i would n't notice . \\n it was as though i had never changed , as though i still gazed at her from the woods and she still sat on her tire swing and watched me with admiring eyes . \\n peeling off my skin / leaving just my eyes behind / you see inside my head / still know that you are mine . \\n `` what are you thinking ? '' \\n i asked , cracking an egg into a skillet and pouring her a glass of orange juice with human fingers that seemed suddenly precious . \\n grace laughed . \\n `` that you 're making me breakfast . '' \\n it was too simple an answer ; i was n't sure if i could believe it . \\n not when i had a thousand thoughts competing for space in my head at the same moment . \\n `` what else are you thinking ? '' \\n `` that it 's very sweet of you . \\n that i hope you know how to cook eggs . '' \\n but her eyes lifted from the skillet to my mouth , just for a second , and i knew she was n't only thinking about eggs . \\n she whirled away and pulled the blinds , instantly changing the mood in the kitchen . \\n `` and it 's too bright in here . '' \\n the light filtered through the blinds , casting horizontal stripes across her wide brown eyes and the straight line of her lips . \\n i turned back to the scrambled eggs and tipped them onto a plate just as the toast popped out of the toaster . \\n i reached for it at the same time as grace , and it was just one of those perfect movie moments where the hands touch and you know the characters are going to kiss . \\n only this time it was my arms somehow accidentally circling her , pinning her against the counter as i reached for the toast , and bracing against the edge of the fridge as i leaned forward . \\n lost in embarrassment over my bumbling , i did n't even realize it was the perfect moment until i saw grace 's eyes close , face lifted toward mine . \\n i kissed her . \\n just the barest brush of my lips against hers , nothing animal . \\n even in that moment , i deconstructed the kiss : her possible reactions to , her possible interpretations of , the way it made a shudder tighten my skin , the seconds between when i touched her lips and when she opened her eyes . \\n grace smiled at me . \\n her words were taunting , but her voice was gentle . \\n `` is that all you 've got ? '' \\n i touched my lips to hers again , and this time , it was a very different sort of kiss . \\n it was six years ' worth of kissing , her lips coming to life under mine , tasting of orange and of desire . \\n her fingers ran through my sideburns and into my hair before linking around my neck , alive and cool on my warm skin . \\n i was wild and tame and pulled into shreds and crushed into being all at once . \\n for once in my human life , my mind did n't wander to compose a song lyric or store the moment for later reflection . \\n for once in my life , i was here and nowhere else . \\n and then i opened my eyes and it was just grace and me-nothing anywhere but grace and me-she pressing her lips together as though she were keeping my kiss inside her , and me , holding this moment that was as fragile as a bird in my hands . \\n chapter seventeen sam 60of some days seem to fit together like a stained glass window . \\n a hundred little pieces of different color and mood that , when combined , create a complete picture . \\n the last twenty-four hours had been like that . \\n the night at the hospital was one pane , sickly green and flickering . \\n the dark hours of the early morning in grace 's bed were another , cloudy and purple . \\n then the cold blue reminder of my other life this morning , and finally the brilliant , clear pane that was our kiss . \\n in the current pane , we sat on the worn bench seat of an old bronco at the edge of a run-down , overgrown car lot on the outskirts of town . \\n it seemed like the complete picture was starting to come into focus , a shimmering portrait of something i thought i could n't have . \\n grace ran her fingers over the bronco 's steering wheel with a thoughtful , fond touch , and then turned to me . \\n `` let 's play twenty questions . '' \\n i was lying back in the passenger seat , eyes closed , and letting the afternoon sun cook me through the windshield . \\n it felt good . \\n `` should n't you be looking at other cars ? \\n you know , car shopping usually involves ... shopping . '' \\n `` i do n't shop very well , '' grace said . \\n `` i just see what i need and i get it . '' \\n i laughed at that . \\n i was beginning to see how very grace such a statement was . \\n she narrowed her eyes at me in mock irritation and crossed her arms over her chest . \\n `` so , questions . \\n these are n't optional . '' \\n i glanced out across the car lot to make sure that the owner had n't returned from towing her car yet-here in mercyfalls , the towing company and the used car company were one and the same . \\n `` okay . \\n better not be anything embarrassing . '' \\n grace slid over a little closer to me on the bench seat and slouched down in a mirror image of my posture . \\n i felt like this was the first question : her leg pressed against my leg , her shoulder pressed against my shoulder , her tightly laced shoe resting on top of my scuffed leather one . \\n my pulse raced , a wordless answer . \\n grace 's voice was pragmatic , as if she did n't know the effect she was having on me . \\n `` i want to know what makes you a wolf . '' \\n that one was easy . \\n `` when the temperature drops , i become a wolf . \\n when it 's cold at night and warm during the day , i can feel it coming on , and then , finally , it 's cold enough that i shift into a wolf until spring . '' \\n `` the others , too ? '' \\n i nodded . \\n `` the longer you 're a wolf , the warmer it has to be for you to become human . '' \\n i paused for a moment , wondering if now was the time to tell her . \\n `` nobody knows how many years you get of switching back and forth . \\n it 's different for every wolf . '' \\n grace just looked at me-the same long look she 'd given me when she was younger , lying in the snow , looking up at me . \\n i could n't read it any better now than i could then . \\n i felt my throat tighten in anticipation of her reply , but , mercifully , she changed her line of questioning . \\n `` how many of you are there ? '' \\n i was n't sure , just because so many of us did n't become humans anymore . \\n `` about twenty . '' \\n `` what do you eat ? '' \\n `` baby bunnies . '' \\n she narrowed her eyes , so i grinned and said , `` adult bunnies , too . \\n i 'm an equal-opportunity bunny-eater . '' \\n she did n't skip a beat . \\n `` what was on your face the night you let me touch you ? '' \\n her voice stayed the same for this question , but something around her eyes tightened , as though she was n't sure she wanted to hear the answer . \\n i had to struggle to remember that night-her fingers in my ruff , her breath moving the fine hairs on the side of my face , the guilty pleasure of being so close to her . \\n the boy . \\n the one who was bitten . \\n that was what she was really asking . \\n `` do you mean there was blood on my face ? '' \\n grace nodded . \\n part of me felt a little sad that she had to ask , but of course she did . \\n she had every reason not to trust me . \\n `` it was n't his-that boy 's . '' \\n `` jack , '' she said . \\n `` jack , '' i repeated . \\n `` i knew the attack happened , but i was n't there for it . '' \\n i had to dig deeper into my memory to trace the source of the blood on my muzzle . \\n my human brain supplied logical answers-rabbit , deer , roadkill-all of them instantly stronger than my actual wolf memories . \\n finally , i snatched the real answer from my thoughts , though i was n't proud of it . \\n `` it was a cat . \\n the blood . \\n i 'd caught a cat . '' \\n grace let out a breath . \\n `` you are n't upset that it was a cat ? '' \\n i asked . \\n `` you have to eat . \\n if it was n't jack , i do n't care if it was a wal - laby , '' she said . \\n but it was obvious her mind was still on jack . \\n i tried to remember what little i knew of the attack , hating for her to think badly of my pack . \\n `` he provoked them , you know , '' i said . \\n `` he what ? \\n you were n't there , were you ? '' \\n i shook my head and struggled to explain . \\n `` we ca n't - the wolves-when we communicate , it 's with images . \\n nothing complicated . \\n and not across great distances . \\n but if we 're right by each other , we can share an image with another wolf . \\n and so the wolves that attacked jack , they showed me images . '' \\n `` you can read each other 's minds ? '' \\n grace asked , incredulous . \\n i shook my head vigorously . \\n `` no . \\n i-it 's hard to explain as a hu-as me . \\n it 's just a way of talking , but our brains are different as wolves . \\n there 's no abstract concepts , really . \\n things like time , and names , and complicated emotions are all out of the question . \\n really , it 's for things like hunting or warning each other of danger . '' \\n `` and what did you see about jack ? '' \\n i lowered my eyes . \\n it felt strange , recalling a wolf memory from a human mind . \\n i flipped through the blurry images in my head , recognizing now that the red blotches on the wolves ' coats were bullet wounds , and that the stains on their lips were jack 's blood . \\n `` some of the wolves showed me something about being hit by him . \\n a-gun ? \\n he must have had a bb gun . \\n he was wearing a red shirt . '' \\n wolves saw color poorly , but red we could see . \\n `` why would he do that ? '' \\n i shook my head . \\n `` i do n't know . \\n that 's not the sort of thing we told each other . '' \\n grace was quiet , still thinking about jack , i suppose . \\n we sat in the close silence until i started to wonder whether she was upset . \\n then she spoke . \\n `` so you never get to open christmas presents . '' \\n i looked at her , not knowing how to respond . \\n christmas was something that happened in another life , one before the wolves . \\n grace looked down at the steering wheel . \\n `` i was just thinking that you were never around in the summer , and i always loved christmas , because i knew you 'd always be there . \\n in the woods . \\n as a wolf . \\n i guess it 's because it 's cold , right ? \\n but that must mean that you never get to open christmas presents . '' \\n i shook my head . \\n i changed too early now to even see christmas decorations in stores . \\n grace frowned at the steering wheel . \\n `` do you think of me when you 're a wolf ? '' \\n when i was a wolf , i was a memory of a boy , struggling to hold on to meaningless words . \\n i did n't want to tell her the truth : that i could n't remember her name . \\n `` i think of the way you smell , '' i said , truthfully . \\n i reached over and lifted a few strands of her hair to my nose . \\n the scent of her shampoo reminded me of the scent of her skin . \\n i swallowed and let her hair fall back down to her shoulder . \\n grace 's eyes followed my hand from her shoulder to my lap , and i saw her swallow , too . \\n the obvious question-when i would change back again-hung between us , but neither of us put words to it . \\n i was n't ready to tell her yet . \\n my chest ached at the thought of leaving all this behind . \\n `` so , '' she said again , and put her hand on the steering wheel . \\n `` do you know how to drive ? '' \\n i pulled my wallet from my jeans pocket and proffered it . \\n `` the state of minnesota seems to think so . '' \\n she extracted my driver 's license , held it up against the steering wheel , and read out loud : `` samuel k. roth . '' \\n she added , with some surprise , `` this is an actual license . \\n you must really be real . '' \\n i laughed . \\n `` you still doubt it ? '' \\n instead of answering , grace handed my wallet back and asked , `` is that your real name ? \\n are n't you supposedly dead , like jack ? '' \\n i was n't sure i wanted to talk about this , but i answered anyway . \\n `` it was n't the same . \\n i was n't bitten as badly , and some strangers saved me from being dragged off . \\n nobody pronounced me dead , like they did with jack . \\n so , yes , that 's my real name . '' \\n grace looked thoughtful , and i wondered what she was thinking . \\n then , abruptly , she looked at me , expression dark . \\n `` so your parents know what you are , right ? \\n that 's why they - '' she stopped and sort of half closed her eyes . \\n i could see her swallowing again . \\n `` it makes you sick for weeks afterward , '' i said , rescuing her from finishing the sentence . \\n `` the wolf toxin , i guess . \\n while it 's changing you . \\n i could n't stop shifting back and forth , no matter how warm or cold i was . '' \\n i paused , the memories flickering through my head like photos from someone else 's camera . \\n `` they thought i was possessed . \\n then it got warm and i improved-became stable , i mean , and they thought i was cured . \\n saved , i suppose . \\n until winter . \\n for a while they tried to get the church to do something about me . \\n finally they decided to do something themselves . \\n they 're both serving life sentences now . \\n they did n't realize that we 're harder to kill than most people . '' \\n grace 's face was nearing a pale shade of green and the knuckles on her hand clutching the steering wheel had turned white . \\n `` let 's talk about something else . '' \\n `` i 'm sorry , '' i said , and i really was . \\n `` let 's talk about cars . \\n is this one your betrothed ? \\n i mean , assuming it runs okay ? \\n i do n't know anything about cars , but i can at least pretend . \\n ` runs okay ' sounds like something someone would say if they knew what they were talking about , right ? '' \\n she seized the subject , petting the steering wheel . \\n `` i do like it . '' \\n `` it 's very ugly , '' i said generously . \\n `` but it looks as though it would laugh at snow . \\n and , if you hit a deer , it would just hiccup and keep going . '' \\n grace added , `` plus , it 's got a pretty appealing front seat . \\n i mean , i can just - '' grace leaned across the bench seat toward me , lightly resting one of her hands on my leg . \\n now she was an inch away from me , close enough that i felt the heat of her breath on my lips . \\n close enough that i could feel her waiting for me to lean into her , too . \\n in my head , an image flashed of grace in her backyard , her hand outstretched , imploring me to come to her . \\n but i could n't , then . \\n i was in another world , one that demanded i keep my distance . \\n now , i could n't help but wonder whether i still lived in that world , bound by its rules . \\n my human skin was only mocking me , taunting me with riches that would vanish at the first freeze . \\n i sat back from her , and looked away before i could see her disappointment . \\n the silence was thick around us . \\n `` tell me about after you were bitten , '' i said , just to say something . \\n `` did you get sick ? '' \\n grace leaned back in her seat and sighed . \\n i wondered how many times i 'd disappointed her before . \\n `` i do n't know . \\n it seems like such a long time ago . \\n i guess-maybe . \\n i remember having the flu right afterward . '' \\n after i was bitten , it had felt like the flu , too . \\n exhaustion , hot and cold shakes , nausea burning the back of my throat , bones aching to change form . \\n grace shrugged . \\n `` that was the year i got locked in the car , too . \\n it was a month or two after the attack . \\n it was spring , but it was really hot . \\n my dad took me along with him to run some errands , because i guess i was too young to leave behind . '' \\n she glanced at me to see if i was listening . \\n i was . \\n `` anyway , i had the flu , i guess , and i was just stupid with sleep . \\n so on the way home i fell asleep in the backseat ... and the next thing i remember was waking up in the hospital . \\n i guess dad had gotten home and gotten the groceries out and forgotten about me . \\n just left me locked in the car , i guess . \\n they said i tried to get out , but i do n't remember that , really . \\n i do n't remember anything until the hospital , where the nurse was saying that it was the hottest may day on record for mercyfalls . \\n the doctor told my dad the heat in the car should 've killed me , so i 'm a miracle girl . \\n how 's that for responsible parenting ? '' \\n i shook my head in disbelief . \\n there was a brief silence that gave me enough time to notice the consternation in her expression and remind me that i sincerely regretted not kissing her a moment ago . \\n i thought about saying show me what you meant earlier , when you said that you liked this front seat . \\n but i could n't imagine my mouth forming those words , so instead i just took her hand and ran my finger along her palm and between her fingers , tracing the lines in her hand and letting my skin memorize her fingerprints . \\n grace made a small sound of appreciation and closed her eyes as my fingers whispered circles on her skin . \\n somehow this was almost better than kissing . \\n both of us jerked when someone tapped on the glass on my side of the car . \\n the tow-truck driver and car-lot owner stood there , peering in at us . \\n his voice came through , muffled by the glass . \\n `` you find what you were looking for ? '' \\n grace reached across and rolled down the window . \\n she was talking to him but looking at me , gaze intense , when she said , `` absolutely . '' \\n chapter eighteen grace 38of that night , sam stayed in my bed again , chastely perched on the farthest edge of the mattress , but somehow , during the night , our bodies migrated together . \\n i half woke early in the morning , long before dawn , the room washed clean by pale moonlight , and found that i was pressed up against sam 's back , my hands balled up to my chest like a mummy . \\n i could just barely see the dark curve of his shoulder , and something about the shape it made , the gesture it suggested , filled me with a sort of fierce , awful affection . \\n his body was warm and he smelled so good-like wolf , and trees , and home-that i buried my face in his shoulder and closed my eyes again . \\n he made a soft noise and rolled his shoulders back against me , pressing closer . \\n right before i drifted back to sleep again , my breathing slowing to match his , i had a brief , burning thought : i ca n't live without this . \\n there had to be a cure . \\n chapter nineteen grace 72of the next day was unseasonably fair , too beautiful to be going to school , but i could n't skip a second day without coming up with a really good excuse . \\n it was n't that i 'd get too far behind ; it just seemed that when you never miss school for a certain length of time , people tend to notice when you do . \\n rachel had already called twice and left an ominous voicemail saying i 'd picked the wrong day to cut class , grace brisbane ! \\n olivia had n't called since our argument in the hall , so i guessed that meant we were n't on speaking terms . \\n sam drove me to school in the bronco while i hastily caught up on some of my english homework i had n't done the day before . \\n once he 'd parked , i opened the door , letting in a gust of unseasonably warm air . \\n sam turned his face toward the open door , his eyes half-closed . \\n `` i love this weather . \\n i feel so me . '' \\n watching him bask in the sun , winter seemed a million miles away , and i could n't imagine him leaving me . \\n i wanted to memorize the crooked line of his nose for later daydreaming . \\n for a moment , i felt an irrational stab of guilt that my feelings for sam were replacing those that i 'd had for my wolf-until i remembered that he was my wolf . \\n all over again , i had the weird sensation of the ground shifting beneath me at the fact of his existence , immediately followed by relief . \\n my obsession was so-easy now . \\n the only thing i had to explain to my friends was where my new boyfriend had come from . \\n `` i guess i have to go , '' i said . \\n `` i do n't want to . '' \\n sam 's eyes opened the rest of the way and focused on me . \\n `` i 'll be here when you come back , promise . '' \\n he added , very formal , `` may i use your car ? \\n i 'd like to see if beck 's still human , and if not , whether his house has the power turned on . '' \\n i nodded , but part of me hoped the power would be off at beck 's house . \\n i kind of wanted sam back in my bed , where i could keep him from disappearing like the dream that he was . \\n i climbed out of the bronco with my backpack . \\n `` do n't get any tickets , speed racer . '' \\n as i came around the front of the vehicle , sam rolled down his window . \\n `` hey ! '' \\n `` what ? '' \\n shyly , he said , `` come here , grace . '' \\n i smiled at the way he said my name and returned to the window , smiling wider when i realized what he wanted . \\n his careful kiss did n't fool me ; as soon as i parted my lips slightly , he sighed and pulled back . \\n `` i 'll make you late for school . '' \\n i grinned . \\n i was on top of the world . \\n `` you 'll be back at three ? '' \\n `` would n't miss it . '' \\n i watched him pull out of the lot , already feeling the length of the school day stretching before me . \\n a notebook smacked my arm . \\n `` who was that ?! '' \\n i turned to rachel and tried to think of something that was easier than the truth . \\n `` my ride ? '' \\n rachel did n't push the issue , mostly because her brain was already on to something else . \\n she grabbed my elbow and began steering me toward the school . \\n surely , surely , there had to be some kind of eternal reward waiting for me for going to school on a gorgeous day like this with sam in my car . \\n rachel wiggled my arm to get my attention . \\n `` grace . \\n focus . \\n there was a wolf outside of the school yesterday . \\n in the parking lot . \\n like , everyone saw it when school got out . '' \\n `` what ? '' \\n i turned and looked over my shoulder at the lot , trying to imagine a wolf amongst the cars . \\n the sparse pine trees that bordered the lot did n't connect with boundary wood ; the wolf would 've had to cross several streets and yards to get to the parking lot . \\n `` what did it look like ? '' \\n rachel gave me a weird look . \\n `` the wolf ? '' \\n i nodded . \\n `` like a wolf . \\n gray . '' \\n rachel saw my withering look and shrugged . \\n `` i do n't know , grace . \\n bluish-gray ? \\n with mucky gross scratches on its shoulder . \\n it looked scruffy . '' \\n so it was jack . \\n it had to be . \\n `` it must have been total chaos , '' i said . \\n `` yeah , you should 've been here , wolf-girl . \\n seriously . \\n nobody got hurt , thank god , but olivia completely freaked out . \\n the whole school was freaked out . \\n isabel was totally hysterical and made a huge scene . '' \\n rachel squeezed my arm . \\n `` so why did n't you pick up your phone , anyway ? '' \\n we walked into the school ; the doors were propped open to let in the balmy air . \\n `` battery died . '' \\n rachel made a face and spoke louder to be heard over the crush of students in the halls . \\n `` so , are you sick ? \\n i never thought i 'd live to see the day that you did n't make it to class . \\n between you not being in class and wild animals roaming the parking lot , i thought the world was coming to an end . \\n i was waiting for the rains of blood . '' \\n `` i think i got some sort of twenty-four-hour bug , '' i replied . \\n `` ew , should i not touch you ? '' \\n but instead of moving away , rachel slammed her shoulder into mine with a grin . \\n i laughed and shoved her off , and as i did , i saw isabel culpeper . \\n my smile faded . \\n she was leaning against the wall by one of the drinking fountains , her shoulders hunched forward . \\n at first i thought she was looking at her cell phone , but then i realized her hands were empty and she was just staring at the ground . \\n if she had n't been such an ice princess , i would 've thought she was crying . \\n i wondered if i should talk to her . \\n as if reading my thoughts , isabel looked up then , and her eyes , so similar to jack 's , met mine . \\n i could read the challenge in them : so what are you looking at , huh ? \\n i looked away quickly and kept walking with rachel , but i had the uncomfortable sense of things left unsaid . \\n chapter twenty sam 39of as i lay in grace 's bed that night , jarred by the news of jack 's appearance at the school , i stared , sleepless , out into a blackness interrupted only by the dim halo of her hair on her pillow . \\n and i thought about wolves who did n't act like wolves . \\n and i thought about christa bohlmann . \\n it had been years since the memory of christa had crossed my mind , but grace 's frowning account of jack lurking where he did n't belong had brought it all back . \\n i remembered the last day i saw her , when christa and beck were fighting in the kitchen , the living room , the hall , the kitchen again , growling and shouting at each other like circling wolves . \\n i 'd been young , about eight , so beck had seemed like a giant then-a narrow , furious god barely containing his anger . \\n round and round the house he went with christa , a heavyset young woman with a face made blotchy by rage . \\n `` you killed two people , christa . \\n when are you going to face up to that ? '' \\n `` killed ? \\n killed ? '' \\n her voice was shrill to my ears , claws on glass . \\n `` what about me ? \\n look at me . \\n my life is over . '' \\n `` it 's not over , '' beck snapped . \\n `` you 're still breathing , are n't you ? \\n your heart 's still beating ? \\n i ca n't say the same for your two victims . '' \\n i remember shrinking back at christa 's voice-a throaty , barely understandable scream . \\n `` this is not a life ! '' \\n beck raged at her about selfishness and responsibility , and she shot back with a string of profanity that i was shocked by ; i 'd never heard the words before . \\n `` how about that guy in the basement ? '' \\n beck snapped . \\n i could just see beck 's back from my vantage point in the hall . \\n `` you bit him , christa . \\n you 've ruined his life now . \\n and you killed two people . \\n just because they called you some nasty words . \\n i keep waiting to see some remorse . \\n hell , i 'll just take a guarantee that this wo n't happen again . '' \\n `` why would i guarantee you anything ? \\n what have you ever given me ? '' \\n christa snarled . \\n her shoulders hunched and twitched . \\n `` you call yourselves a pack ? \\n you 're a coven . \\n you 're an abomination . \\n you 're a cult . \\n i 'll do what i want . \\n i 'll get through this life how i want . '' \\n beck 's voice was terribly , terribly even . \\n i remember being suddenly sorry for christa then , because beck stopped sounding angry when he was at his worst . \\n `` promise me this wo n't happen again . '' \\n she looked straight at me then-no , not at me . \\n through me . \\n her mind was someplace far away , escaping the reality of her changing body . \\n i could see a vein standing out right down the middle of her forehead , and i noticed that her fingernails were claws . \\n `` i do n't owe you anything . \\n go to hell . '' \\n beck said , very quietly , `` get out of my house . '' \\n she did . \\n she slammed the glass door so hard that the dishes in the kitchen cabinets rattled . \\n a few moments later , i heard the door open and shut again , much quieter , as beck went after her . \\n i remembered that it had been cold enough out that i was worried beck would change for the winter and leave me alone in the house . \\n that fear was enough to make me slide out of the hallway into the living room , just as i heard a massive crack . \\n beck quietly let himself back into the house , shivering with the cold and the threat of the change , and he carefully laid a gun on the counter as though it was made of glass . \\n then he noticed me , standing in the living room , arms across my chest , my fingers clutching my biceps . \\n i still remembered the way his voice sounded when he said , `` do n't touch that , sam . '' \\n hollow . \\n ragged . \\n he 'd gone into his office and laid his head down on his arms for the rest of the day . \\n at dusk , he and ulrik had gone outside , voices low and hushed ; through the window , i 'd seen ulrik get a shovel from the garage . \\n and now , here i was , lying in grace 's bed , and somewhere out there was jack . \\n angry people did n't make good werewolves . \\n while grace was in school , i had driven by beck 's house . \\n the driveway was empty and the windows were dark ; i had n't the heart to go inside and see how long it had been unoccupied . \\n without beck to enforce the pack 's safety , who was supposed to keep jack in line ? \\n an unwelcome sense of responsibility was starting to pinch at the back of my throat . \\n beck had a cell phone , but i could n't remember the number , no matter how long i riffled through my memories . \\n i pressed my face against the pillow and prayed that jack would n't bite anyone , because if he became a problem , i did n't think i was strong enough to do what would have to be done . \\n chapter twenty-one sam 57of when grace 's alarm went off the next morning at 6:45 for school , screaming electronic obscenities into my ear , i instantly shot straight up into the air , heart pounding , just as i had the day before . \\n my head was stuffed full of dreams : wolves and humans and blood smeared on lips . \\n `` ummmm , '' grace mumbled , unconcerned , and pulled up the sheets around her neck . \\n `` turn that off , would you ? \\n i 'm getting up . \\n i 'll ... be up in a second . '' \\n she rolled over , her blonde head barely visible above the edge of the blanket , and sank into the bed as if she had grown into the mattress . \\n and that was it . \\n she was asleep and i was not . \\n i leaned back against her headboard and let her lie by my side , warm and dreaming , for a few minutes more . \\n i stroked her hair with careful fingers , tracing a line from her forehead around her ear and down to just the top of her long neck , where her hair stopped being hair proper and was instead little baby fluffs that went every which way . \\n they were fascinating , these soft feathers that would grow up to be her hair . \\n i was incredibly tempted to bend down and bite them , ever so softly , to wake her up and kiss her and make her late for school , but i could n't stop thinking about jack and christa and people who made bad werewolves . \\n if i went to the school , would i still be able to follow jack 's trail with my weaker sense of smell ? \\n `` grace , '' i whispered . \\n `` wake up . '' \\n she made a soft noise that , roughly translated , meant piss off in sleep language . \\n `` time to wake up , '' i said , and stuck my finger in her ear . \\n grace squealed and smacked at me . \\n she was up . \\n our mornings together were beginning to have the comfort of routine . \\n while grace , still dogged by sleep , stumbled toward the shower , i put a bagel in the toaster for each of us and convinced the coffeemaker to do something that sounded like making coffee . \\n back in her bedroom , i listened to grace sing tunelessly in the shower while i pulled on my jeans and checked her drawers for socks that did n't look too girly for me to borrow . \\n i heard my breathing stop without feeling it . \\n photographs , nestled amongst her neatly folded socks . \\n pictures of the wolves . \\n of us . \\n carefully , i lifted the stack out of the drawer and retreated to the bed . \\n turning my back to the door as if i were doing something illicit , i paged through the pictures with slow fingers . \\n there was something fascinating about seeing these images with my human eyes . \\n some of the wolves i could attach human names to ; the older ones who had always changed before me . \\n beck , big , bulky , blue-gray . \\n paul , black and clean-looking . \\n ulrik , brownish-gray . \\n salem , with his notched ear and running eye . \\n i sighed , though i did n't know why . \\n the door behind me opened , letting in a gust of steam that smelled like grace 's soap . \\n grace stepped behind me and rested her head on my shoulder ; i breathed in the scent of her . \\n `` looking at yourself ? '' \\n she asked . \\n my fingers , flicking between the photos , froze . \\n `` i 'm in here ? '' \\n grace came round the side of the bed and sat down facing me . \\n `` of course . \\n most of them are of you-you do n't recognize yourself ? \\n oh . \\n of course you would n't . \\n tell me who 's who . '' \\n slower , i paged through the images again as she shifted to sit next to me , the bed groaning with her movements . \\n `` that 's beck . \\n he 's always taken care of the new wolves . '' \\n though there 'd only been two newly made wolves since me : christa and the wolf that she 'd created , derek . \\n the fact was , i was n't used to younger newcomers-our pack usually grew by other , older wolves finding us , not by the addition of savagely born newbies like jack . \\n `` beck 's like a father to me . '' \\n it sounded weird to say it like that , even if it was true . \\n i 'd never had to explain it to anyone before . \\n he had been the one to take me under his wing after i 'd escaped from my house , and the one who carefully glued the fragments of my sanity back together . \\n `` i could tell how you felt about him , '' grace said , and she sounded surprised at her own intuition . \\n `` your voice is different whenever you talk about him . '' \\n `` it is ? '' \\n now it was my turn to be surprised . \\n `` different how ? '' \\n she shrugged , looking a little shy . \\n `` i dunno . \\n proud , i guess . \\n i think it 's sweet . \\n who 's that ? '' \\n `` shelby , '' i said , and there was no pride in my voice for her . \\n `` i told you about her before . '' \\n grace watched my face . \\n the memory of the last time shelby and i had seen each other made my gut twist uncomfortably . \\n `` she and i do n't see things the same way . \\n she thinks being a wolf is a gift . '' \\n beside me , grace nodded , and i was grateful to leave it at that . \\n i flipped through the next few photographs , more of shelby and beck , until i paused at paul 's black form . \\n `` that 's paul . \\n he 's our pack leader when we 're wolves . \\n that 's ulrik next to him . '' \\n i pointed to the brown-gray wolf beside paul . \\n `` ulrik 's like a crazy uncle , sort of . \\n a german one . \\n he swears a lot . '' \\n `` sounds great . '' \\n `` he 's a lot of fun . '' \\n actually , i should 've said was a lot of fun . \\n i did n't know if this had been his last year , or if he might still have another summer in him . \\n i remembered his laugh , like a flock of crows taking off , and the way he held on to his german accent , like he could n't be ulrik without it . \\n `` are you okay ? '' \\n grace asked , frowning at me . \\n i shook my head , staring at the wolves in the photographs , so clearly animals when seen through my human eyes . \\n my family . \\n me . \\n my future . \\n somehow , the photographs blurred a line i was n't ready to cross yet . \\n i realized grace had her arm around my shoulder , her cheek leaning against me , comforting me even though she could n't possibly understand what was bothering me . \\n `` i wish you could 've met them , '' i said , `` when everybody was human . '' \\n i did n't know how to explain to her what an enormous part of me they were , their voices and faces as humans , and their scents and forms as wolves . \\n how lost i felt now , the only one wearing human skin . \\n `` tell me something about them , '' grace said , her voice muffled against my t-shirt . \\n i let my mind flit over memories . \\n `` beck taught me how to hunt when i was eight . \\n i hated it . '' \\n i remembered standing in beck 's living room , staring out at the first ice-covered tree branches of the winter , brilliant and winking in the morning sun . \\n the backyard seemed like a dangerous and alien planet . \\n `` why did you hate it ? '' \\n grace asked . \\n `` i did n't like the sight of blood . \\n i did n't like hurting things . \\n i was eight . '' \\n in my memories , i seemed small , ribby , innocent . \\n i had spent all of the previous summer letting myself believe that this winter , with beck , would be different , that i would n't change and that i 'd go on eating the eggs beck cooked for me forever . \\n but as the nights grew colder and even short trips outside made my muscles shake , i knew the time was coming soon when i would n't be able to avoid the change , and that beck would n't be around to cook much longer . \\n but that did n't mean i would go willingly . \\n `` why hunt , then ? '' \\n grace asked , ever logical . \\n `` why not just leave food out for yourselves ? '' \\n `` ha . \\n i asked beck that same question , and ulrik said , ` ja , and the raccoons and possums , too ? ' '' \\n grace laughed , unduly delighted by my lousy impression of ulrik 's accent . \\n i felt a rush of warmth in my cheeks ; it felt good to talk to her about the pack . \\n i loved the glow in her eyes , the curious quirk in her mouth-she knew what i was and she wanted to know more . \\n but that did n't mean it was right to tell her , someone outside the pack . \\n beck had always said , the only people we have to protect us is us . \\n but beck did n't know grace . \\n and grace was n't only human . \\n she may not have changed , but she had been bitten . \\n she was wolf on the inside . \\n she had to be . \\n `` so what happened ? '' \\n grace asked . \\n `` what did you hunt ? '' \\n `` bunnies , of course , '' i replied . \\n `` beck took me out while paul waited in a van to collect me afterward in case i was unstable enough to change back . '' \\n i could n't forget how beck had stopped me by the door before we went out , bending double so he could look into my face . \\n i was motionless , trying not to think about changing bodies and snapping a rabbit 's neck between my teeth . \\n about saying good-bye to beck for the winter . \\n he had taken my thin shoulder in his hand and said , `` sam , i 'm sorry . \\n do n't be scared . '' \\n i had n't said anything , because i was thinking it was cold , and beck would n't change back after the hunt , and then i 'd have no one who knew how to cook my eggs right . \\n beck made perfect eggs . \\n more than that . \\n beck kept me sam . \\n back then , with the scars on my wrists still so fresh , i 'd been so dangerously close to fracturing into something that was neither human nor wolf . \\n `` what are you thinking about ? '' \\n grace asked . \\n `` you stopped talking . '' \\n i looked up ; i had n't realized i 'd looked away from her . \\n `` changing . '' \\n grace 's chin pressed into my shoulder as she looked into my face ; her voice was hesitant . \\n she asked me a question she 'd asked me before . \\n `` does it hurt ? '' \\n i thought of the slow , agonizing process of the change , the bending of muscles , the bulging of skin , the grinding of bones . \\n the adults had always tried to hide their shifts from me , wanting to protect me . \\n but it was n't seeing them change that scared me-the sight only made me pity them , since even beck groaned with the pain of it . \\n it was changing myself that terrified me , even now . \\n forgetting sam . \\n i was a bad liar , so i did n't bother to try . \\n `` yes . '' \\n `` it kind of makes me sad to think of you having to do that as a little kid , '' grace said . \\n she was frowning at me , blinking too-shiny eyes . \\n `` actually , it bothers me a lot . \\n poor little sam . '' \\n she touched my chin with a finger ; i leaned into her hand . \\n i remembered being so proud that i had n't cried while i changed that time , unlike when i was younger and my parents had watched me , eyes round with horror . \\n i remembered beck the wolf , bounding away and leading me into the woods , and i remembered the warm , bitter sensation of my first kill on my muzzle . \\n i had changed back again after paul , bundled up in a coat and hat , had retrieved me . \\n it was in the van on the way home that loneliness hit me . \\n i was alone ; beck would n't be human again that year . \\n now , it was like i was eight years old all over again , alone and newly scarred . \\n my chest ached , my breath squeezed out of me . \\n `` show me what i look like , '' i asked grace , tilting the photos toward her . \\n `` please . '' \\n i let her take the stack from my hand and watched her face light up as she flipped through the pictures , looking for one in particular . \\n `` there . \\n that one 's my favorite of you . '' \\n i looked at the photo she had handed me . \\n a wolf looked back at me , wearing my eyes , a still wolf watching from the woods , sunlight touching the edges of its fur . \\n i looked and looked , waiting for it to mean something . \\n waiting for a prickling of recognition . \\n it seemed unfair that the other wolves ' identities were so clear to me in their photographs , but that mine was hidden . \\n what was it in this photo , in that wolf , that made grace 's eyes light up ? \\n what if it was n't me ? \\n what if she was in love with some other wolf and she only thought it was me ? \\n how would i ever know ? \\n grace was oblivious to my doubts and misread my silence for fascination . \\n she unfolded her legs and stood up , facing me , then ran a hand through my hair . \\n she lifted her palm to her nose , inhaling deeply . \\n `` you know , you still smell like you do when you 're a wolf . '' \\n and just like that , she 'd said maybe the one thing that could 've made me feel better . \\n i handed her the photo on her way out . \\n grace stopped in the door , dimly silhouetted by the dull gray morning light , and looked back at me , at my eyes , my mouth , my hands , in a way that made something inside me knot and unknot unbearably . \\n i did n't think i belonged here in her world , a boy stuck between two lives , dragging the dangers of the wolves with me , but when she said my name , waiting for me to follow , i knew i 'd do anything to stay with her . \\n chapter twenty-two sam 62of i spent too long after dropping grace off circling the parking lot , frustrated with jack , frustrated with the rain , frustrated with the limitations of my human body . \\n i could smell that a wolf had been there-just a faint , musky trace of wolf odor-but i could n't pinpoint a direction or even say for sure that it had been jack . \\n it was like being blind . \\n i gave up finally and , after sitting in the car for several minutes , decided to give in to the pull of beck 's house . \\n i could n't think of anywhere else in particular to start a search for jack , but the woods behind the house were a logical place to find wolves in general . \\n so i headed back toward my old summer home . \\n i did n't know if beck had been a human at all this year ; i could n't even clearly recall my own summer months . \\n memories blurred into each other until they became a composite of seasons and scents , their origins obscured . \\n beck had been shifting for more years than i had , so it seemed unlikely that he 'd been human this year when i had n't . \\n but it also felt like i should have had more years of changing back and forth than this . \\n i had n't been shifting for that long . \\n where had my summers gone ? \\n i wanted beck . \\n i wanted his guidance . \\n i wanted to know why the gunshot had made me human . \\n i wanted to know how long i had with grace . \\n i wanted to know if this was the end . \\n `` you 're the best of them , '' he had told me once , and i still remembered the way his face looked when he said it . \\n square , trustworthy , solid . \\n an anchor in a churning sea . \\n i had known what he meant : the most human of the pack . \\n that was after they 'd pulled grace from her tire swing . \\n but when i drove up to the house , it was still empty and dark , and my hopes dissipated . \\n it occurred to me that all of the other wolves must 've already shifted for the winter ; there were n't many young wolves left . \\n except for jack , now . \\n the mailbox was stuffed with envelopes and slips from the post office advising beck to pick up more at the main office . \\n i took all of it out and put it in grace 's car . \\n i had a key for his post office box , but i 'd get it later . \\n i refused to think i would n't see beck again . \\n but the fact remained that if beck was n't around , jack had n't been shown the ropes . \\n and someone had to get him away from the school and civilization until he stopped the unpredictable shifting that came with being a new wolf . \\n his death had done enough damage to the pack . \\n i was n't going to let him expose us , either through shifting in public or through biting someone . \\n since jack had already paid a visit to the school , i decided to operate under the assumption that he had tried going home as well , and so i headed over toward the culpepers ' place . \\n it was n't any secret where they lived ; everybody in town knew the gigantic tudor mansion that could be just glimpsed from the highway . \\n the only mansion in mercyfalls . \\n i did n't think anybody would be home at this time of the day , but i parked grace 's bronco about a half mile away just in case and cut through the pine woods on foot . \\n sure enough , the house was empty , towering over me like a massive structure out of an old folktale . \\n a quick poking around the doors turned up the unmistakable odor of wolf . \\n i could n't tell whether he 'd gotten inside already , or if , like me , he 'd come while everyone was away and returned to the woods already . \\n remembering how vulnerable i was in my human form , i whirled around and sniffed the air , scanning the surrounding pines for signs of life . \\n nothing . \\n or at least nothing close enough that my human senses could pick it up . \\n in the cause of thoroughness , i broke into the house to see whether jack was there , already sequestered in a locked room reserved for monsters . \\n i was n't tidy about my breaking - and-entering job , either ; i shattered a window in the back door with a brick and reached through the jagged hole to turn the knob . \\n inside , i scented the air again . \\n i thought i smelled wolf , but it was faint and somewhat stale . \\n i was n't sure why jack would smell that way , but i followed the scent through the house . \\n my path led to a massive set of oak doors ; i felt sure the trail was leading to the other side . \\n carefully i pushed them open , then inhaled sharply . \\n the massive foyer in front of me was filled with animals . \\n stuffed ones . \\n and not the cuddly kind . \\n the dim , high-ceilinged room had the feel of a museum exhibit : animals of north america , or some sort of shrine to death . \\n my mind snatched for song lyrics , but could only settle on a single line : we bear the grins of the smiling dead . \\n i shuddered . \\n in the half-light that filtered through the round windows high above my head , it seemed as though there were enough animals to populate noah 's ark . \\n here was a fox , stiffly holding a stuffed quail in its mouth . \\n there , a black bear , rising above me with claws outstretched . \\n a lynx , creeping eternally along a log . \\n and a polar bear , complete with stuffed fish in his paws . \\n could you stuff a fish ? \\n i had n't ever considered it . \\n and then , amidst a herd of deer of all sizes and shapes , i saw the source of the smell i had detected earlier : a wolf stared over its shoulder at me , teeth bared , glass eyes menacing . \\n i walked toward it , reaching out to touch its brittle fur . \\n under my fingers , the stale smell blossomed , releasing secrets in my nostrils , and i recognized the unique scent of my woods . \\n i curled my fingers into a fist , stepping back from the wolf with crawling skin . \\n one of us . \\n maybe not . \\n maybe just a wolf . \\n except i 'd never met a normal wolf in our woods before . \\n `` who were you ? '' \\n i whispered . \\n but the only common feature between a werewolf 's two forms-the eyes-had long since been gouged out in favor of a pair of glass ones . \\n i wondered whether derek , riddled with bullets the night i was shot , would join this wolf in this macabre menagerie . \\n the thought twisted my stomach . \\n i glanced around the hall once more and retreated toward the front door . \\n every bit of animal still left in me was screaming to get away from the dull odor of death that filled the hall . \\n jack was n't here . \\n i did n't have any reason to stay . \\n chapter twenty-three grace 52of `` good morning . '' \\n dad glanced at me as he poured coffee into a travel mug . \\n he was very sharply dressed for a saturday ; he must be trying to sell a resort to some rich investor . \\n `` i have to meet ralph at the office at eight-thirty . \\n about the wyndhaven resort . '' \\n i blinked a few times , eyes bleary . \\n my whole body felt sticky and slow from sleep . \\n `` do n't talk to me yet . \\n i 'm not awake . '' \\n through my fog , i felt a twinge of guilt for not being more friendly ; i had n't really seen him for days , much less properly spoken with him . \\n sam and i had spent last night talking about the strange room of stuffed animals at the culpepers ' and wondering , with the constant irritation of a scratchy sweater , where jack was going to make his next appearance . \\n this ordinary morning with dad felt like an abrupt return to my pre-sam life . \\n dad gestured at me with the coffeepot . \\n `` want some of this ? '' \\n i cupped my hands and held them toward him . \\n `` just pour it in there . \\n i 'll splash some on my face . \\n where 's mom ? '' \\n i did n't hear her crashing around upstairs . \\n mom 's getting ready to leave the house normally required a lot of indiscriminate banging and shoe-scraping noises from the bedroom . \\n `` some gallery down in minneapolis . '' \\n `` why 'd she leave so early ? \\n it 's practically yesterday . '' \\n dad did n't answer ; he was looking over the top of my head at the tv , which was blaring some morning talk show . \\n the show 's guest , dressed in khaki , was surrounded by all sorts of baby animals in boxes and cages . \\n it reminded me vividly of the room of animals that sam had described . \\n dad frowned as one of the two hosts gingerly petted a baby possum , who hissed . \\n i cleared my throat . \\n `` dad . \\n focus . \\n get me a coffee mug and fill it or i 'll die . \\n and i 'm not cleaning up my body if i do . '' \\n dad , still watching the tv , felt around in the cabinet for a mug . \\n his fingers found my favorite-a robin egg 's blue mug that one of mom 's friends had made-and pushed it and the coffeepot across the counter to me . \\n the steam rushed into my face as i poured . \\n `` so , grace , how 's school ? '' \\n i asked myself . \\n dad nodded , eyes on the baby koala now struggling in the guest 's arms . \\n `` oh , it 's fine , '' i continued , and dad made a mumbling noise of agreement . \\n i added , `` nothing special , aside from the load of pandas they brought in , and the teachers abandoning us to cannibalistic savages - '' i paused to see if i 'd caught his attention yet , then pressed on . \\n `` the whole building caught fire , then i failed drama , and then sex sex sex sex . '' \\n dad 's eyes abruptly focused , and he turned to me and frowned . \\n `` what did you say they were teaching you in school ? '' \\n well , at least he 'd caught more of the beginning than i 'd given him credit for . \\n `` nothing interesting . \\n we 're writing short stories for english . \\n they 're hateful . \\n i have absolutely no talent for writing fiction . '' \\n `` fiction about sex ? '' \\n he asked doubtfully . \\n i shook my head . \\n `` go to work , dad . \\n you 're going to be late . '' \\n dad scratched his chin ; he 'd missed a hair shaving . \\n `` that reminds me . \\n i need to take that cleaner back to tom . \\n have you seen it ? '' \\n `` you need to take cleaner back to who ? '' \\n `` the gun cleaner . \\n i think i put it on the counter . \\n or maybe under it - '' he crouched and began to rummage in the cabinet under the sink . \\n i frowned at him . \\n `` why did you have gun cleaner ? '' \\n he gestured toward his study . \\n `` for the gun . '' \\n little warning bells were going off in my head . \\n i knew my dad had a rifle ; it hung on the wall in his study . \\n but i could n't remember him ever cleaning it before . \\n you cleaned guns after you 'd used them , right ? \\n `` why were you borrowing cleaner ? '' \\n `` tom loaned it to me to clean my rifle after we were out . \\n i know i should clean it more , but i just do n't think about it when i 'm not using it . '' \\n `` tom culpeper ? '' \\n i said . \\n he withdrew his head from the cabinet , bottle in hand . \\n `` yes . '' \\n `` you went shooting with tom culpeper ? \\n that was you the other day ? '' \\n my cheeks were beginning to feel hot . \\n i prayed for him to say no . \\n dad gave me a look . \\n the sort that was usually followed by him saying something like grace , you 're usually so reasonable . \\n `` something had to be done , grace . '' \\n `` you were part of that hunting party ? \\n the one that went after the wolves ? '' \\n i demanded . \\n `` i ca n't believe that you - '' the image of dad creeping through the trees , rifle in hand , the wolves fleeing before him , was suddenly too strong , and i had to stop . \\n `` grace , i did it for you , too , '' he said . \\n my voice came out very low . \\n `` did you shoot any of them ? '' \\n dad seemed to realize that the question was important . \\n `` warning shots , '' he said . \\n i did n't know if it was true or not , but i did n't want to talk to him anymore . \\n i shook my head and turned away . \\n `` do n't sulk , '' dad said . \\n he kissed my cheek-i remained motionless as he did-and gathered up his coffee and briefcase . \\n `` be good . \\n see you later . '' \\n standing in the kitchen , hands cupped around the blue mug , i listened as dad 's taurus rumbled to life in the driveway and then faded slowly away . \\n after he 'd gone , the house settled into its familiar silence , both comforting and depressing . \\n it could 've been any other morning , just the quiet and the coffee in my hands-but it was n't . \\n dad 's voice-warning shots-still hung in the air . \\n he knew how i felt about the wolves , and he 'd gone behind my back and made plans with tom culpeper , anyway . \\n the betrayal stung . \\n a soft noise from the doorway caught my attention . \\n sam stood in the hallway , his hair wet and spiky from a shower , his eyes on me . \\n there was a question written on his face , but i did n't say anything . \\n i was wondering what dad would do if he knew about sam . \\n chapter twenty-four grace 52of i spent the better part of the morning and afternoon slogging through my english homework while sam stretched on the couch , a novel in hand . \\n it was a vague sort of torture to be in the same room with him but separated quite effectively by an english textbook . \\n after several hours only punctuated by a brief lunch break , i could n't take it anymore . \\n `` i feel like i 'm wasting our time together , '' i confessed . \\n sam did n't answer , and i realized he had n't heard me . \\n i repeated my statement , and he blinked , eyes slowly focusing on me as he returned from whatever world he 'd been in . \\n he said , `` i 'm happy just to be here with you . \\n that 's enough . '' \\n i studied his face for a long moment , trying to decide if he really meant it . \\n noting his page number , sam folded the novel shut with careful fingers and said , `` do you want to go somewhere ? \\n if you 've gotten enough done , we can go poke around beck 's house , to see if jack 's made his way back over there . '' \\n i liked the idea . \\n ever since jack 's appearance at school , i 'd felt uneasy about where and how he might turn up next . \\n `` do you think he 'll be there ? '' \\n `` i do n't know . \\n the new wolves always seemed to find their way there , and that 's where the pack tends to live , in that stretch of boundary wood behind the house , '' sam said . \\n `` it 'd be nice to think he 'd finally found his way to the pack . '' \\n his face looked worried then , but he stopped short of saying why . \\n i knew why i wanted jack to fit in with the pack-i did n't want anyone exposing the wolves for what they were . \\n but sam seemed to be concerned about something more , something bigger and more nameless . \\n in the golden afternoon light , i drove the bronco to beck 's house while sam navigated . \\n we had to follow the winding road around boundary wood for a good thirty-five minutes to get to the house . \\n i had n't realized how far the wood stretched until we drove all the way around it . \\n i guess it made sense ; how could you hide an entire pack of wolves without hundreds of unpopulated acres to help ? \\n i pulled the bronco into the driveway , squinting up at the brick facade . \\n the dark windows looked like closed eyes ; the house was overwhelmingly empty . \\n when sam cracked his door open , the sweet smell of the pines that stood guard around the yard filled my nostrils . \\n `` nice house . '' \\n i stared at the tall windows glinting in the afternoon sun . \\n a brick house of this size could easily look imposing , but there was an atmosphere about the property that seemed disarming-maybe the sprawling , unevenly cut hedges out front or the weathered bird feeder that looked as if it had grown out of the lawn . \\n it was a comfortable sort of place . \\n it looked like the sort of place that would create a boy like sam . \\n i asked , `` how did beck get it ? '' \\n he frowned . \\n `` the house ? \\n he used to be a lawyer for rich old guys , so he 's got money . \\n he bought it for the pack . '' \\n `` that 's awfully generous of him , '' i said . \\n i shut the car door . \\n `` crap . '' \\n sam leaned over the hood of the bronco toward me . \\n `` what ? '' \\n `` i just locked the keys in the car . \\n my brain was on autopilot . '' \\n sam shrugged dismissively . \\n `` beck 's got a slim-jim in the house . \\n we can get it when we get back from the woods . '' \\n `` a slim-jim ? \\n how intriguing , '' i said , grinning at him . \\n `` i like a man with hidden depths . '' \\n `` well , you 've got one , '' sam replied . \\n he jerked his head toward the trees in the backyard . \\n `` are you ready to head in ? '' \\n the idea was both compelling and terrifying . \\n i had n't been in the woods since the night of the hunt , and before that , the evening i 'd seen jack pinned by the other wolves . \\n it seemed like my only memories of these woods were of violence . \\n i realized sam was holding his hand out toward me . \\n `` are you afraid ? '' \\n i wondered if there was a way to take his hand without admitting my fear . \\n not fear , really . \\n just some emotion that crawled along my skin and lifted the hairs on my arms . \\n it was cool weather , not the barren dead of winter . \\n plenty of food for the wolves without them having to attack us . \\n wolves are shy creatures . \\n sam took my hand ; his grip was firm and his skin warm against mine in the cool autumn air . \\n his eyes studied me , large and luminescent in the afternoon glow , and for a moment i was caught in his gaze , remembering those eyes studying me from a wolf 's face . \\n `` we do n't have to look for him now , '' he said . \\n `` i want to go . '' \\n it was true . \\n part of me wanted to see where sam lived in these cold months , when he was n't lingering at the edge of our yard . \\n and part of me , the part that ached with loss when the pack howled at night , was begging to follow that faint scent of the pack into the woods . \\n all of that outweighed any bit of me that was anxious . \\n to prove my willingness , i headed toward the backyard , nearing the edge of the woods , still holding sam 's hand . \\n `` they 'll stay away from us , '' sam said , as if he still had to convince me . \\n `` jack 's the only one who would approach us . '' \\n i looked over to him with a crooked eyebrow . \\n `` yeah , about that . \\n he 's not going to come at us all slathering and horror movie , is he ? '' \\n `` it does n't make you a monster . \\n it just takes away your inhi - bitions , '' sam said . \\n `` did he slather a lot when he was in school ? '' \\n like the rest of the school , i had heard the story about how jack had put some kid in the hospital after a party ; i had dismissed it as gossip until i 'd seen the guy for myself , walking the halls with half his face still swollen . \\n jack did n't need a transformation to become a monster . \\n i made a face . \\n `` he slathered a bit , yeah . '' \\n `` if it makes you feel any better , '' sam said , `` i do n't think he 's here . \\n but i still hope he is . '' \\n so we went into the woods . \\n this was a different sort of forest from the one that bordered my parents ' yard . \\n these trees were pressed tightly together , the underbrush crammed between the trunks as if holding them upright . \\n brambles caught on my jeans , and sam kept stopping to pick burrs off our ankles . \\n we saw no sign of jack , or any of the wolves , during our slow progress . \\n in truth , i did n't think sam was doing a very good job of scanning the woods around us . \\n i made a big show of looking around so i could pretend i did n't notice him glancing at me every few seconds . \\n it did n't take me long to get a headful of burrs , tugging my hairs painfully as they worked their way into knots . \\n sam stopped me to pick at the burrs . \\n `` it gets better , '' he promised . \\n it was sweet that he thought i would get put out enough to go back to the car . \\n as if i had anything better to do than feel him carefully worry the barbs of the burrs out of my hair . \\n `` i 'm not worried about that , '' i assured him . \\n `` i 'm just thinking we 'd never know if there was anyone else here . \\n the woods go on forever . '' \\n sam ran his fingers through my hair as if he were checking for more burrs , though i knew they were all gone , and he probably did , too . \\n he paused , smiling at me , and then inhaled deeply . \\n `` does n't smell like we 're alone . '' \\n he looked at me , and i knew he was waiting for me to verify-to admit that if i tried , i could smell the scent of the pack 's hidden life all around us . \\n instead , i reached for his hand again . \\n `` lead the way , bloodhound . '' \\n sam 's expression turned a bit wistful , but he led me through the underbrush , up a gradual hill . \\n as he promised , it got better . \\n the thorns thinned out and the trees grew taller and straighter , their branches not beginning until a few feet over our heads . \\n the white , peeled bark of the birches looked buttery in the long , slanting afternoon light , and their leaves were a delicate gold . \\n i turned to sam , and his eyes reflected the same brilliant yellow back at me . \\n i stopped in my tracks . \\n it was my woods . \\n the golden woods i 'd always imagined running away to . \\n sam , watching my face , dropped his hand out of mine and stepped back to look at me . \\n `` home , '' he said . \\n i think he was waiting for me to say something . \\n or maybe he was n't waiting for me to say something . \\n maybe he saw it on my face . \\n i did n't have anything to say-i just looked around at the shimmering light and the leaves hanging on the branches like feathers . \\n `` hey . '' \\n sam caught my arm , looking at my face sideways , as if searching for tears . \\n `` you look sad . '' \\n i turned in a slow circle ; the air seemed dappled and vibrant around me . \\n i said , `` i used to always imagine coming here , when i was younger . \\n i just ca n't figure out how i would 've seen it . '' \\n i probably was n't making any sense , but i kept talking , trying to reason it out . \\n `` the woods behind my house do n't look like this . \\n no birches . \\n no yellow leaves . \\n i do n't know how i would recognize it . '' \\n `` maybe someone told you about it . '' \\n `` i think i would remember someone telling me every little detail about this part of the woods , down to the color of the glittering air . \\n i do n't even know how someone could 've told me all that . '' \\n sam said , `` i told you . \\n wolves have funny ways of communicating . \\n showing each other pictures when they 're close to one another . '' \\n i turned back to where he was standing , a dark blot against the light , and gave him a look . \\n `` you are n't going to stop , are you ? '' \\n sam just gazed at me steadily , the silent lupine stare that i knew so well , sad and intent . \\n `` why do you keep bringing it back up ? '' \\n `` you were bitten . '' \\n he walked in a slow circle around me , scuffing up leaves with his foot , glancing at me underneath his dark eyebrows . \\n `` so ? '' \\n `` so it 's about who you are . \\n it 's about you being one of us . \\n you could n't have recognized this place if you were n't a wolf , too , grace . \\n only one of us would 've been able to see what i showed you . '' \\n his voice was so serious , his eyes so intense . \\n `` i could n't - i could n't even talk to you right now if you were n't like us . \\n we are n't supposed to talk about who we are with regular people . \\n it 's not as if we have a ton of rules to live by , but beck told me that 's one rule we just do n't break . '' \\n that did n't make sense to me . \\n `` why not ? '' \\n sam did n't say anything , but his fingers touched his neck where he 'd been shot ; as he did , i saw the pale , shiny scars on his wrist . \\n it seemed wrong for someone as gentle as sam to have to always wear evidence of human violence . \\n i shivered in the growing chill of the afternoon . \\n sam 's voice was soft . \\n `` beck 's told me stories . \\n people kill us in all kinds of awful ways . \\n we die in labs and we get shot and we get poisoned . \\n it might be science that changes us , grace , but all people see is magic . \\n i believe beck . \\n we ca n't tell people who are n't like us . '' \\n i said , `` i do n't change , sam . \\n i 'm not really like you . '' \\n disappointment stuck a lump in my throat that i could n't swallow . \\n he did n't answer . \\n we stood together in the wood for a long moment before he sighed and spoke again . \\n `` after you were bitten , i knew what would happen . \\n i waited for you to change , every night , so i could bring you back and keep you from getting hurt . '' \\n a chilly gust of wind lifted his hair and sent a shower of golden leaves glimmering down around him . \\n he spread out his arms , letting them fall into his hands . \\n he looked like a dark angel in an eternal autumn wood . \\n `` did you know you get one happy day for every one you catch ? '' \\n i did n't know what he meant , even after he opened his fist to show me the quivering leaves crumpled in his palm . \\n `` one happy day for every falling leaf you catch . '' \\n sam 's voice was low . \\n i watched the edges of the leaves slowly unfold , fluttering in the breeze . \\n `` how long did you wait ? '' \\n it would 've been unbearably romantic if he 'd had the courage to look into my face and say it , but instead , he dropped his eyes to the ground and scuffed his boot in the leaves-countless possibilities for happy days-on the ground . \\n `` i have n't stopped . '' \\n and i should 've said something romantic , too , but i did n't have the courage , either . \\n so instead , i watched the shy way he was chewing his lip and studying the leaves , and said , `` that must 've been very boring . '' \\n sam laughed , a funny , self-deprecating laugh . \\n `` you did read a lot . \\n and spent too much time just inside the kitchen window , where i could n't see you very well . '' \\n `` and not enough time mostly na ** d in front of my bedroom window ? '' \\n i teased . \\n sam turned bright red . \\n `` that , '' he said , `` is so not the point of this conversation . '' \\n i smiled sweetly at his embarrassment , beginning to walk again , kicking up golden leaves . \\n i heard him scuffing leaves behind me . \\n `` and what was the point of it again ? '' \\n `` forget it ! '' \\n sam said . \\n `` do you like this place or not ? '' \\n i stopped in my tracks , spinning to face him . \\n `` hey . '' \\n i pointed at him ; he raised his eyebrows and stopped in his tracks . \\n `` you did n't think jack would be here at all , did you ? '' \\n his thick dark eyebrows went up even farther . \\n `` did you really intend to look for him at all ? '' \\n he held his hands up as if in surrender . \\n `` what do you want me to say ? '' \\n `` you were trying to see if i would recognize it , were n't you ? '' \\n i took another step , closing the distance between us . \\n i could feel the heat of his body , even without touching him , in the increasing cold of the day . \\n `` you told me about this wood somehow . \\n how did you show it to me ? '' \\n `` i keep trying to tell you . \\n you wo n't listen . \\n because you 're stubborn . \\n it 's how we speak-it 's the only words we have . \\n just pictures . \\n just simple little pictures . \\n you have changed , grace . \\n just not your skin . \\n i want you to believe me . '' \\n his hands were still raised , but he was starting to grin at me in the failing light . \\n `` so you only brought me here to see this . '' \\n i stepped forward again , and he stepped back . \\n `` do you like it ? '' \\n `` under false pretenses . '' \\n another step forward ; another back . \\n the grin widened . \\n `` so do you like it ? '' \\n `` when you knew we would n't come across anybody else . '' \\n his teeth flashed in his grin . \\n `` do you like it ? '' \\n i punched my hands into his chest . \\n `` you know i love it . \\n you knew i would . '' \\n i went to punch him again , and he grabbed my wrists . \\n for a moment we stood there like that , him looking down at me with the grin half-caught on his face , and me looking up at him : still life with boy and girl . \\n it would 've been the perfect moment to kiss me , but he did n't . \\n he just looked at me and looked at me , and by the time i realized i could just as easily kiss him , i noticed that his grin was slipping away . \\n sam slowly lowered my wrists and released them . \\n `` i 'm glad , '' he said , very quietly . \\n my arms still hung by my sides , right where sam had put them . \\n i frowned at him . \\n `` you were supposed to kiss me . '' \\n `` i thought about it . '' \\n i just kept looking at the soft , sad shape of his lips , looking just like his voice sounded . \\n i was probably staring , but i could n't stop thinking about how much i wanted him to kiss me and how stupid it was to want it so badly . \\n `` why do n't you ? '' \\n he leaned over and gave me the lightest of kisses . \\n his lips , cool and dry , ever so polite and incredibly maddening . \\n `` i have to get inside soon , '' he whispered . \\n `` it 's getting cold . '' \\n for the first time i paid attention to the icy wind that cut through my long sleeves . \\n one of the frigid gusts hurled thousands of fallen leaves back into the air , and for a single second , i thought i smelled wolf . \\n sam shuddered . \\n squinting at his face in the dim light , i realized suddenly that his eyes were afraid . \\n chapter twenty-five sam 37of we did n't run back to the house . \\n running would 've meant acknowledging something that i was n't ready to face in front of her-something that i was . \\n instead , we walked with a giant 's strides , dried leaves and branches snapping under our feet , our breaths drowning out the other sounds of the evening . \\n cold snaked under my collar , tightening my skin into goose bumps . \\n if i did n't let go of her hand , i 'd be all right . \\n a wrong turn would lead us away from the house , but i could n't concentrate on the trees around me . \\n my vision flashed with jerky memories of humans shifting into wolves , hundreds of shifts over my years with the pack . \\n the memory of the first time i 'd seen beck shift was vivid in my mind-more real than the screaming red sunset through the trees in front of grace and me . \\n i remembered the frigid white light streaming in the living room windows of beck 's house , and i remembered the shaking line of his shoulders as he braced his arms against the back of the sofa . \\n i stood beside him , looking up , no words in my mouth . \\n `` take him out ! '' \\n beck shouted , his face toward the hallway but his eyes half-closed . \\n `` ulrik , take sam out of here ! '' \\n ulrik 's fingers around my arm then were as tight as grace 's fingers around my hand were now , pulling me through the woods , leading us back over the trail we 'd left earlier . \\n night crouched in the trees , waiting to overtake us , cold and black . \\n but grace did n't look away from the sun glowing through the trees as she headed toward it . \\n the brilliant nimbus of the sun half blinded me , making stark silhouettes of the trees , and suddenly i was seven again . \\n i saw the star pattern of my old bedspread so clearly that i stumbled . \\n my fingers clutched the fabric , balling and tearing it under my grip . \\n `` mama ! '' \\n my voice broke on the second syllable . \\n `` mama , i 'm going to be sick ! '' \\n i was tangled on the floor in blankets and noise and puke , shaking and clawing at the floor , trying to hold on to something , when my mother came to the bedroom door , a familiar silhouette . \\n i looked at her , my cheek resting against the floor , and i started to say her name , but no sound came out . \\n she dropped to her knees and she watched me change for the first time . \\n `` finally , '' grace said , tearing my brain back to the woods around us . \\n she sounded out of breath , as if we 'd been running . \\n `` there it is . '' \\n i could n't let grace see me change . \\n i could n't change now . \\n i followed grace 's gaze to the back of beck 's house , a flash of warm red-brown in this chilly blue evening . \\n and now i ran . \\n two steps from the car , all my hopes of getting warm in the bronco were crushed in the moment it took for grace to uselessly tug the locked door handle . \\n inside , the keys swung from the ignition with her effort . \\n grace 's face twisted with frustration . \\n `` we 'll have to try the house , '' she said . \\n we did n't have to break into beck 's house . \\n he always left a spare key stuck in the weather lining of the back door . \\n i tried not to think of the car keys hanging in the bronco 's ignition ; if we had them , i would 've been warm again already . \\n my hands shook as i pulled the spare key from the lining and tried to slide it into the dead bolt . \\n i was hurting already . \\n hurry up , you idiot . \\n hurry up . \\n i just could n't stop shaking . \\n grace carefully took the key from me , with not even a hint of fear , though she had to know what was happening . \\n she closed one of her warm hands over my cold , shuddering ones , and with the other she shoved the key into the knob and unlocked it . \\n god , please let the power be on . \\n please let the heat be on . \\n her hand on my elbow pushed me inside the dark kitchen . \\n i could n't shed the cold ; it clung to every bit of me . \\n my muscles began to cramp and i put my fingers over my face , shoulders hunched . \\n `` no , '' grace said , her voice even and firm , just like she was answering a simple question . \\n `` no , come on . '' \\n she pulled me away from the door and shut it behind me . \\n her hand slid along the wall by the door , finding the light switches , and miraculously , the lights flickered on , coming to ugly , fluorescent life above us . \\n grace pulled on me again , dragging me farther away from the door , but i did n't want to move . \\n i just wanted to curl in on myself and give in . \\n `` i ca n't , grace . \\n i ca n't . '' \\n i did n't know if i 'd said it out loud or not , but she was n't listening to me if i had . \\n instead , she sat me on the floor directly on top of an air vent , and she pulled off her jacket to wrap around my shoulders and over the top of my head . \\n then she crouched in front of me and gathered my cold hands against her body . \\n i shook and clenched my teeth to keep them from chattering , trying to focus on her , on being human , on getting warm . \\n she was saying something ; i could n't understand her . \\n she was too loud . \\n everything was too loud . \\n it smelled in here . \\n this close , her scent was exploding in my nostrils . \\n i hurt . \\n everything hurt . \\n i whined , very softly . \\n she leaped up and ran down the hall , her hands smacking light switches as she did , and then she disappeared . \\n i groaned and put my head down on my knees . \\n no , no , no , no . \\n i did n't even know what i was supposed to be fighting anymore . \\n the pain ? \\n the shuddering ? \\n she was back . \\n her hands were wet . \\n she grabbed my wrists and her mouth moved , her voice ringing out , indecipherable . \\n sounds meant for someone else 's ears . \\n i stared at her . \\n she pulled again ; she was stronger than i thought she was . \\n i got to my feet ; my height somehow surprised me . \\n i shivered so violently that her jacket fell from my shoulders . \\n the cold air hitting my neck racked me with another shudder and i nearly went to my knees . \\n the girl got a better grip on my arms and pulled me along , talking all the time , low , soothing sounds with an edge of iron beneath them . \\n she pushed me into a doorway ; heat emanated from inside it . \\n god , no . \\n no . \\n no . \\n i pulled and fought against her hold , eyes locked on the far wall of the little tiled room . \\n a bathtub lay in front of me like a tomb . \\n steam rolled off the water , the heat tempting and wonderful , but every part of my body resisted . \\n `` sam , do n't fight me ! \\n i 'm sorry . \\n i 'm sorry , i do n't know what else to do . '' \\n eyes fixed on the tub , i hooked my fingers on the edge of the door . \\n `` please , '' i whispered . \\n in my head , the hands held me down in the tub , hands that smelled of childhood and familiarity , of hugs and clean sheets and everything i 'd ever known . \\n they pushed me into the water . \\n it was warm , the temperature of my body . \\n the voices counted together . \\n they did n't say my name . \\n cut . \\n cut . \\n cut . \\n cut . \\n they were poking holes in my skin , letting what was inside get out . \\n the water turned red in little wispy strands . \\n i gasped , struggled , cried . \\n they did n't speak . \\n the woman cried into the water as she held me down . \\n i 'm sam , i told them , holding my face above the red water . \\n i 'm sam . \\n i 'm sam . \\n i 'm `` sam ! '' \\n the girl ripped me from the door and pushed off the wall against me ; i stumbled and fell toward the tub . \\n she shoved me as i fought to regain my balance , sending my head smacking against the wall and into the steaming water . \\n i lay perfectly still , sinking , water closing over my face , scalding my skin , boiling my body , drowning my shudders . \\n grace gently lifted my head above water , cradling it in her arms , one foot in the tub behind me . \\n she was sopping wet and shivering . \\n `` sam , '' she said . \\n `` god , i 'm sorry . \\n i 'm so sorry . \\n i 'm sorry . \\n i did n't know what else to do . \\n please forgive me . \\n i 'm sorry . '' \\n i could n't stop shaking , my fingers gripped on the side of the tub . \\n i wanted out . \\n i wanted her to hold me , so i could feel safe . \\n i wanted to forget the blood running from the scars on my wrists . \\n `` get me out , '' i whispered . \\n `` please get me out . '' \\n `` are you warm enough ? '' \\n i could n't answer . \\n i was bleeding to death . \\n i balled my hands into fists and drew them to my chest . \\n every caress of water over my wrists sent a new wave of shivers through me . \\n her face was full of pain . \\n `` i 'm going to find the thermostat and turn the heat up . \\n sam , you have to stay in there until i come back with towels . \\n i 'm so sorry . '' \\n i closed my eyes . \\n i passed a lifetime with my head held barely above water , unable to move , and then grace came back , holding a stack of mismatched towels . \\n she knelt by the tub and reached past me ; i heard a gurgle behind my head . \\n i felt myself slipping down the drain with the water in red circling swirls . \\n `` i ca n't get you out if you do n't help . \\n please , sam . '' \\n she stared at me as if she was waiting for me to move . \\n the water drained away from my wrists , my shoulders , my back , until i lay in an empty tub . \\n grace laid a towel on top of me ; it was very warm , as if she 'd heated it somehow . \\n then she took one of my scarred wrists in her hands and looked at me . \\n `` you can come out now . '' \\n i looked back at her , unblinking , my legs folded up the side of the tiled wall like a giant insect . \\n she reached down and traced my eyebrows . \\n `` you do have really beautiful eyes . '' \\n `` we get to keep them , '' i said . \\n grace started at my voice . \\n `` what ? '' \\n `` it 's the one thing we keep . \\n our eyes stay the same . '' \\n i unclenched my fists . \\n `` i was born with these eyes . \\n i was born for this life . '' \\n as if there was no bitterness in my voice , grace replied , `` well , they 're beautiful . \\n beautiful and sad . '' \\n she reached down and took my fingers , her eyes locked on mine , holding my gaze . \\n `` do you think you can stand up now ? '' \\n and i did . \\n looking at her brown eyes and nothing else , i stepped out of the tub , and she led me out of the bathroom and back into my life . \\n chapter twenty-six grace 35of i could n't keep my thoughts together . \\n i stood in the kitchen , staring at the cabinets , which were covered with pinned-up photographs of smiling people-the pack members as humans . \\n normally , i would 've looked through them to find sam 's face , but i kept seeing the broken shape of his body in the bathtub and hearing the terror in his voice . \\n the vision of him shaking in the woods right before i realized what was happening to him replayed over and over in my head . \\n saucepan . \\n can of soup . \\n bread from freezer . \\n spoons . \\n beck 's kitchen was obviously stocked by someone who was familiar with a werewolf 's peculiar schedule ; it was full of canned goods and boxed foods with long shelf lives . \\n i lined up all of the ingredients for a makeshift dinner on the counter , forcing myself to concentrate on the task at hand . \\n in the next room , sam sat on the couch under a blanket , his clothing running through the wash . \\n my jeans were still soaking , but they 'd have to wait . \\n turning on a burner for the soup , i tried to focus on the slick black controls , the shiny aluminum surface . \\n but instead i remembered sam convulsing on the floor , eyes vacant , and the animal whimper he made as he realized that he was losing himself . \\n my hands shook as i tipped the soup from the can to the saucepan . \\n i could n't keep it together . \\n i would keep it together . \\n i saw the look on his face as i shoved him into the bathtub , just like his parents must have - god , i could n't think about that . \\n opening the fridge , i was surprised to see a gallon of milk , the first perishable food i 'd found in the house . \\n it looked so out of place that i felt my thoughts sharpen . \\n checking the expiration date-only three weeks ago-i poured the odiferous milk down the drain and frowned into the fridge for other signs of recent life . \\n sam was still curled on the couch when i emerged from the kitchen to hand him a bowl of soup and some toast . \\n he accepted it with a more mournful look than usual . \\n `` you must think i 'm a total freak . '' \\n i sat on a plaid chair across from him , tucking my legs beneath me , and held my bowl of soup against my chest for warmth . \\n the living room ceiling went all the way up to the roof and the room was still drafty . \\n `` i am so sorry . '' \\n sam shook his head . \\n `` it was the only thing you could do . \\n i just-i should n't have lost it that way . '' \\n i winced , remembering the crack of his head hitting the wall and his splayed fingers , reaching through the air as he careened into the tub . \\n `` you did really well , '' sam said , glancing at me as he picked at the toast . \\n he seemed to consider his words , and then just repeated , `` you did really well . \\n are you - '' he hesitated and then looked to where i sat , several feet away from him . \\n something in his glance made the empty stretch of couch next to him painfully obvious . \\n `` i 'm not afraid of you ! '' \\n i said . \\n `` is that what you think ? \\n i just thought you 'd like some elbow room while you ate . '' \\n actually , any other time i 'd have happily crawled under the blanket with him-especially with him looking warm and sexy in a set of old sweats he 'd gotten from his room . \\n but i just wanted-i just needed to put my thoughts in order , and did n't think i could do that while sitting next to him just yet . \\n sam smiled , relief all over his face . \\n `` the soup 's good . '' \\n `` thanks . '' \\n it was n't actually that good-in fact , it tasted completely canned and bland , but i was hungry enough that i did n't care . \\n and the mechanical action of eating helped dull the images of sam in the bathtub . \\n `` tell me more about the mind-meld thing , '' i said , wanting to keep him talking , to hear his human voice . \\n sam swallowed . \\n `` the what ? '' \\n `` you said you showed me the woods , when you were a wolf . \\n and that the wolves talked to each other that way . \\n tell me more about it . \\n i want to know how it works . '' \\n sam leaned forward to set his bowl on the floor , and when he sat back and looked at me , his face looked tired . \\n `` it 's not like that . '' \\n `` i did n't say it was like anything ! '' \\n i said . \\n `` not like what ? '' \\n `` it 's not a superpower , '' he replied . \\n `` it 's a consolation prize . '' \\n when i just looked at him , he added , `` it 's the only way we get to communicate . \\n we ca n't remember words . \\n we could n't say them even if we could wrap our wolf brains around them . \\n so all we get are little images that we can send to each other . \\n simple images . \\n postcards from the other side . '' \\n `` can you send me one now ? '' \\n sam slouched down on the couch , tightening the blanket around himself . \\n `` i ca n't even remember how to do it now . \\n while i 'm me . \\n i only do it when i 'm a wolf . \\n why would i need it now ? \\n i have words . \\n i can say anything i want to you . '' \\n i thought about saying but words are n't enough , but just thinking it made me ache in an unfamiliar way . \\n so instead i said , `` but i was n't a wolf when you showed me the woods . \\n so can the wolves talk to other pack members when those members are human ? '' \\n sam 's heavy-lidded eyes flicked over my face . \\n `` i do n't know . \\n i do n't think i ever tried with anyone else . \\n just wolves . '' \\n he said , again , `` why would i need to ? '' \\n there was something bitter and tired in his voice . \\n i set my bowl down on the end table and joined him on the couch . \\n he lifted the blanket so that i could press myself against his side , and then he leaned his forehead against mine , closing his eyes . \\n for a long moment , he just rested there , and then he opened his eyes again . \\n `` all i cared about was showing you how to get home , '' he said , voice low . \\n his breath warmed my lips . \\n `` when you changed , i wanted to make sure you knew how to find me . '' \\n i ran my fingers across the triangle of bare chest that was visible above the loose collar of his sweatshirt . \\n my voice came out a little uneven . \\n `` well , i found you . '' \\n the dryer buzzed from down the hall , a strange sound of occupation in this empty house . \\n sam blinked and leaned back . \\n `` i should get my clothing . '' \\n he opened his mouth as if he was going to say something else and blushed instead . \\n `` the clothing 's not going anywhere , '' i said . \\n `` neither are we , if we do n't break into the bronco to get the keys , '' sam pointed out . \\n `` i 'm thinking sooner rather than later for that . \\n especially since it 's going to have to be you doing it . \\n i ca n't stand out there that long . '' \\n i reluctantly moved back so that he could stand , holding the blanket around him like some sort of primitive chieftain . \\n i could see the outline of his square shoulders underneath it and thought about the feel of his skin underneath my fingers . \\n he saw me looking and held my gaze for half a second before vanishing into the dark hallway . \\n something gnawed inside me , hungry and wanting . \\n i sat on the couch after he left , debating whether or not to follow him to the laundry room , until reason won over . \\n i took the plates to the kitchen , then returned to the living room to poke around the bits and pieces on the mantel . \\n i wanted to get a handle on the werewolf he called beck , the one who owned the house . \\n the one who had raised sam . \\n the living room , like the exterior of the house , looked comfortable and lived in . \\n it was all tartans and rich reds and dark wood accents . \\n one wall of the living room was almost entirely made up of tall windows , and the now-dark winter night seemed to enter the room without permission . \\n i turned my back on the windows and looked at a photo on the mantel : a loosely posed group of faces smiling at the camera . \\n it made me think of the picture of rachel , olivia , and me , and i felt a twinge of loss before focusing on the people in this photo . \\n out of the six figures in the photo , my eyes immediately found sam . \\n this was a slightly younger version of him , with summer-tanned skin . \\n the one girl in the photograph stood next to him , about his age , her white-blonde hair reaching beyond her shoulders . \\n she was the only one not smiling at the camera . \\n instead , she was looking at sam in an intense way that made my stomach churn . \\n a soft touch on my neck made me whirl around , defensive , and sam jumped back , laughing , hands up in the air . \\n `` easy ! '' \\n i swallowed the growl in my throat , feeling stupid , and rubbed the still-tingling skin on my neck where he 'd kissed it . \\n `` you should make some noise . '' \\n i gestured to the photo , still feeling uncharitable toward the unnamed girl beside him . \\n `` who 's that ? '' \\n sam lowered his hands and stood behind me , wrapping his arms around my stomach . \\n his clothing smelled clean and soapy ; his skin gave off hints of wolf from his near-transformation earlier . \\n `` shelby . '' \\n he leaned his head on my shoulder , his cheek against mine . \\n i kept my voice light . \\n `` she 's pretty . '' \\n sam growled in a soft , wild way that made my gut tense with longing . \\n he pressed his lips against my neck , not quite a kiss . \\n `` you 've met her , you know . '' \\n it did n't take rocket science to figure it out . \\n `` the white she - wolf . '' \\n and then i just asked it , because i wanted to know . \\n `` why is she looking at you like that ? '' \\n `` oh , grace , '' he said , taking his lips from my neck . \\n `` i do n't know . \\n she 's - i do n't know . \\n she thinks she 's in love with me . \\n she wants to be in love with me . '' \\n `` why ? '' \\n i asked . \\n he gave a little laugh , not at all amused . \\n `` why do you ask such hard questions ? \\n i do n't know . \\n she had a bad life , i think , before she came to the pack . \\n she likes being a wolf . \\n she likes belonging . \\n i guess maybe she sees how beck and i are around each other and thinks that being with me would make her belong even more . '' \\n `` it is possible to be in love with you just because of who you are , '' i pointed out . \\n sam 's body tensed behind me . \\n `` but it 's not because of who i am . \\n it 's ... obsession . '' \\n `` i 'm obsessed , '' i said . \\n sam let out a long breath and pulled away from me . \\n i sighed . \\n `` shhhhh . \\n you did n't have to move . '' \\n `` i 'm trying to be a gentleman . '' \\n i leaned back against him , smiling at his worried eyes . \\n `` you do n't have to try so hard . '' \\n he sucked in his breath , waited a long moment , and then carefully kissed my neck , just underneath my jawbone . \\n i turned around in his arms so i could kiss his lips , still charmingly hesitant . \\n `` i was thinking about the refrigerator , '' i whispered . \\n sam pulled back , ever so slightly , without removing himself from my arms . \\n `` you were thinking about the refrigerator ? '' \\n `` yes . \\n i was thinking about how you did n't know if the power would be turned on here for the winter . \\n but it is . '' \\n he frowned at me , and i rubbed the crease between his eyebrows . \\n `` so who pays the power bill ? \\n beck ? '' \\n when he nodded , i went on , `` there was milk in the fridge , sam . \\n it was only a few weeks old . \\n someone has been in here . \\n recently . '' \\n sam 's arms around me had loosened and his sad eyes had gone even sadder . \\n his entire expression was complicated , his face a book in a language i did n't understand . \\n `` sam , '' i said , wanting to bring him back to me . \\n but his body had gone stiff . \\n `` i should get you home . \\n your parents will be worried . '' \\n i laughed , short and humorless . \\n `` yeah . \\n i 'm sure . \\n what 's wrong ? '' \\n `` nothing . '' \\n sam shook his head , but he was clearly distracted . \\n `` i mean , not nothing . \\n it 's been a hell of a day , that 's all . \\n i 'm just-i 'm just tired , i guess . '' \\n he did look tired , something dark and somber in his expression . \\n i wondered if almost changing had affected him , or if i should 've just stayed quiet about shelby and beck . \\n `` you 're coming home with me , then . '' \\n he jerked his chin toward the house around him . \\n `` c'mon , '' i said . \\n `` i 'm still worried that you 'll disappear . '' \\n `` i wo n't disappear . '' \\n inadvertently , i thought of him on the floor in the hallway , curled up , making a soft noise as he struggled to stay human . \\n i immediately wished i had n't . \\n `` you ca n't promise that . \\n i do n't want to go home . \\n not unless you 're coming with me . '' \\n sam groaned softly . \\n his palms brushed the bare skin at the bottom edge of my t-shirt , his thumbs tracing desire on my sides . \\n `` do n't tempt me . '' \\n i did n't say anything ; just stood in his arms looking up at him . \\n he pushed his face against my shoulder and groaned again . \\n `` it 's so hard to behave myself around you . '' \\n he pushed away from me . \\n `` i do n't know if i should keep staying with you . \\n god , you 're only , what-you 're only seventeen . '' \\n `` and you 're so old , right ? '' \\n i said , suddenly defensive . \\n `` eighteen , '' he said , as if it were something to be sad about . \\n `` at least i 'm legal . '' \\n i actually laughed , though nothing was funny . \\n my cheeks felt hot and my heart pounded in my chest . \\n `` are you kidding me ? '' \\n `` grace , '' he said , and the sound of my name slowed my heart immediately . \\n he took my arm . \\n `` i just want to do things right , okay ? \\n i only get this one chance to do things right with you . '' \\n i looked at him . \\n the room was silent except for the rattle of leaves blowing up against the windows . \\n i wondered what my face looked like just then , turned up at sam . \\n was it the same intense gaze that shelby wore in the photograph ? \\n obsession ? \\n the frigid night pressed up against the window beside us , a threat that had become abruptly real tonight . \\n this was n't about lust . \\n it was about fear . \\n `` please come back with me , '' i said . \\n i did n't know what i 'd do if he said no . \\n i could n't stand to return here tomorrow and find him a wolf . \\n sam must have seen it in my eyes , because he just nodded and picked up the slim-jim . \\n chapter twenty-seven sam 38of grace 's parents were home . \\n `` they 're never home , '' grace said , her voice clearly spelling out her annoyance . \\n but there they were , or at least their cars : her father 's taurus , looking either silver or blue in the moonlight , and her mother 's little vw rabbit tucked in front of it . \\n `` do n't even think of saying ' i told you so , ' '' grace said . \\n `` i 'm going to go inside and see where they are , and then i 'll come back out to debrief . '' \\n `` you mean , for me to debrief you , '' i corrected , tensing my muscles to keep from shivering . \\n whether from nerves or the memory of cold , i did n't know . \\n `` yes , '' grace replied , turning off the headlights . \\n `` that . \\n right back . '' \\n i watched her run in the house and slunk down into my seat . \\n i could n't quite believe that i was hiding in a car in the middle of a freezing cold night , waiting for a girl to come running back out and tell me the coast was clear to come sleep in her room . \\n not just any girl . \\n the girl . \\n grace . \\n she appeared at the front door and made an elaborate gesture . \\n it took me a moment to realize she meant for me to turn off the bronco and come in . \\n i did so , sliding out of the car as quickly as possible and hurrying quietly up into the front hallway ; cold tugged and bit at my exposed skin . \\n without even letting me pause , grace gave me a shove , launching me down the hall while she shut the front door and headed in toward the kitchen . \\n `` i forgot my backpack , '' she announced loudly in the other room . \\n i used the cover of their conversation to creep into grace 's bedroom and softly shut the door . \\n inside the house , it was easily thirty degrees warmer , a fact for which i was very grateful . \\n i could still feel the trembling in my muscles from being outside ; the sensation of in between that i hated . \\n the cold exhausted me and i did n't know how long grace would be up with her parents , so i climbed into bed without turning on the light . \\n sitting there in the dim moonlight , leaning against the pillows , i rubbed life back into my frozen toes and listened to grace 's distant voice down the hall . \\n she and her mother were having some amiable conversation about the romantic comedy that had just been on tv . \\n i 'd already noticed that grace and her parents had no problem talking about unimportant things . \\n they seemed to have an endless capacity for laughing pleasantly together about inane topics , but i 'd never once heard them talk about anything meaningful . \\n it was so strange to me , coming from the environment of the pack . \\n ever since beck had taken me under his wing , i 'd been surrounded by family , sometimes suffocatingly so , and beck had never failed to give me his undivided attention when i wanted it . \\n i 'd taken it for granted , but now i felt spoiled . \\n i was still sitting up in bed when the doorknob turned quietly . \\n i froze , absolutely still , and then exhaled when i recognized the sound of grace 's breathing . \\n she shut the door behind her and turned toward the window . \\n i saw her teeth in the low light . \\n `` you in here ? '' \\n she whispered . \\n `` where are your parents ? \\n are they going to come in here and shoot me ? '' \\n grace went silent . \\n in the shadows , without her voice , she was invisible to me . \\n i was about to say something to dispel the strangely awkward moment when she said , `` no , they 're upstairs . \\n mom 's making dad sit for her to paint him . \\n so you 're clear to go brush your teeth and stuff . \\n if you do it fast . \\n just sing in a high-pitched voice , so they think it 's me . '' \\n her voice hardened when she said dad , though i could n't imagine why . \\n `` a tone-deaf voice , '' i corrected . \\n grace passed by me on the way to the dresser , swatting at my butt . \\n `` just go . '' \\n leaving my shoes in her room , i padded quietly down the hall to the downstairs bathroom . \\n it only had a stand-up shower , for which i was intensely grateful , and grace had made sure to pull the curtain shut so that i would n't have to look into it , anyway . \\n i brushed my teeth with her toothbrush . \\n then i stood there , a lanky teenager in a big green t-shirt she had borrowed from her father , looking at my floppy hair and yellow eyes in the mirror . \\n what are you doing , sam ? \\n i closed my eyes as if hiding my pupils , so wolflike even when i was a human , would change what i was . \\n the fan for the central heating hummed , sending subtle vibrations through my bare feet , reminding me that it was the only thing keeping me in this human form . \\n the new october nights were already cold enough to rip my skin from me , and by next month , the days would be , too . \\n what was i going to do , hide in grace 's house all winter , fearing every creeping draft ? \\n i opened my eyes again , staring at them in the mirror until their shape and color did n't mean anything . \\n i wondered what grace saw in me , why i fascinated her . \\n what was i without my wolf skin ? \\n a boy stuffed so full of words that they spilled out of me . \\n right now , every phrase , every lyric , that i had in my head ended with the same word : love . \\n i had to tell grace that this was my last year . \\n i peered into the hallway for signs of her parents and crept back into the bedroom , where grace was already in bed , a long , soft lump under the covers . \\n for a moment , i let my imagination run wild as to what she was wearing . \\n i had a dim wolf memory of her climbing out of bed one spring morning , wearing just an oversized t-shirt , her long legs exposed as she slid them out from under the covers . \\n so sexy it hurt . \\n immediately , i felt embarrassed for fantasizing . \\n i sort of paced around at the end of the bed for a few minutes , thinking about cold showers and barre chords and other things that were n't grace . \\n `` hey , '' she whispered , voice muzzy as if she had been asleep already . \\n `` what 're you doing ? '' \\n `` shhh , '' i said , my cheeks flushing . \\n `` sorry i woke you up . \\n i was just thinking . '' \\n her reply was broken by a yawn . \\n `` stop thinking then . '' \\n i climbed into bed , keeping to the edge of the mattress . \\n something about this evening had changed me-something about grace seeing me at my worst , immobile in the bathtub , ready to give up . \\n tonight , the bed seemed too small to escape her scent , the sleepy sound of her voice , the warmth of her body . \\n i discreetly stuffed a bunch of blankets between us and rested my head on the pillow , willing my doubts to fly away and let me sleep . \\n grace reached over and began stroking her fingers through my hair . \\n i closed my eyes and let her drive me crazy . \\n she draws patterns on my face / these lines make shapes that ca n't replace / the version of me that i hold inside / when lying with you , lying with you , lying with you . \\n `` i like your hair , '' she said . \\n i did n't say anything . \\n i was thinking about a melody to go with the lyrics in my head . \\n `` sorry about tonight , '' she whispered . \\n `` i do n't mean to push your boundaries . '' \\n i sighed as her fingers curled around my ears and neck . \\n `` it 's just so fast . \\n i want you to '' - i stopped short of saying love me , because it seemed presumptive - `` want to be with me . \\n i 've wanted it forever . \\n i just never thought it would actually happen . '' \\n it felt too serious , so i added , `` i am just a mythological creature , after all . \\n i technically should n't exist . '' \\n grace laughed , low , just for me . \\n `` silly boy . \\n you feel very real to me . '' \\n `` you do , too , '' i whispered . \\n there was a long pause in the darkness . \\n `` i wish i changed , '' she said finally , barely audible . \\n i opened my eyes , needing to see the way her face looked when she said that . \\n it was more descriptive than any expression i 'd ever seen her wear : immeasurably sad , lips set crookedly with longing . \\n i reached out for her , cupped the side of her face with my hand . \\n `` oh , no , you do n't , grace . \\n no , you do n't . '' \\n she shook her head against the pillow . \\n `` i feel so miserable when i hear the howling . \\n i felt so awful when you disappeared for the summer . '' \\n `` oh , angel , i would take you with me if i could , '' i said , and i was simultaneously surprised that the word angel came out of my mouth and that it felt right to call her that . \\n i ran a hand over her hair , fingers catching in the strands . \\n `` but you do n't want this . \\n i lose more of myself every year . '' \\n grace 's voice was strange . \\n `` tell me what happens , at the end . '' \\n it took me a moment to figure out what she meant . \\n `` oh , the end . '' \\n there were one thousand ways to tell her , a thousand ways to color it . \\n grace would n't fall for the rose-colored version that beck had told me at first , so i just told it straight . \\n `` i become me-become human-later in the spring every year . \\n and one year-i guess i just wo n't change . \\n i 've seen it happen to the older wolves . \\n one year , they do n't become human again , and they 're just ... a wolf . \\n and they live a little longer than natural wolves . \\n but still-fifteen years , maybe . '' \\n `` how can you talk about your own death like that ? '' \\n i looked at her , eyes glistening in the dim light . \\n `` how else could i talk about it ? '' \\n `` like you regret it . '' \\n `` i regret it every day . '' \\n grace was silent , but i felt her processing what i 'd said , pragmatically putting everything into its proper place in her head . \\n `` you were a wolf when you got shot . '' \\n i wanted to press my fingers to her lips , push the words she was forming back into her mouth . \\n it was too soon . \\n i did n't want her to say it yet . \\n but grace went on , her voice low . \\n `` you missed the hottest months this year . \\n it was n't that cold when you got shot . \\n it was cold , but not winter cold . \\n but you were a wolf . \\n when were you a human this year ? '' \\n i whispered , `` i do n't remember . '' \\n `` what if you had n't been shot ? \\n when would you have become you again ? '' \\n i closed my eyes . \\n `` i do n't know , grace . '' \\n it was the perfect moment to tell her . \\n this is my last year . \\n but i could n't say it . \\n not yet . \\n i wanted another minute , another hour , another night of pretending this was n't the end . \\n grace inhaled a slow , shaky breath , and something in the way she did it made me realize that somehow , on some level , she knew . \\n she 'd known all along . \\n she was n't crying , but i thought i might . \\n grace put her fingers back into my hair , and mine were in hers . \\n our bare arms pressed against each other in a cool tangle of skin . \\n every little movement against her arm rubbed off a tiny spark of her scent , a tantalizing mix of flowery soap , faint sweat , and desire for me . \\n i wondered if she knew how transparent her scent made her , how it told me what she was feeling when she did n't say it out loud . \\n of course , i 'd seen her smelling the air just as often as i did . \\n she had to know that she was driving me crazy right now , that every touch of her skin on mine tingled , electric . \\n every touch pushed the reality of the oncoming winter further away . \\n as if to prove me right , grace moved closer , kicking away the blankets between us , pressing her mouth to mine . \\n i let her part my lips and sighed , tasting her breath . \\n i listened to her almost inaudible gasp as i wrapped my arms around her . \\n every one of my senses was whispering to me over and over to get closer to her , closer to her , as close as i could . \\n she twined her bare legs in mine and we kissed until we had no more breath and got closer until distant howls outside the window brought me back to my senses . \\n grace made a soft noise of disappointment as i disentangled my legs from hers , aching with wanting more . \\n i shifted to lie next to her , my fingers still caught in her hair . \\n we listened to the wolves howling outside the window , the ones who had n't changed . \\n or who would never change again . \\n and we buried our heads against each other so we could n't hear anything but the racing of our hearts . \\n chapter twenty-eight grace 49of school felt like an alien planet on monday . \\n it took me a long moment of sitting behind the wheel of the bronco , watching the students milling on the sidewalks and the cars circling the lot and the buses filing neatly into place , to realize that school had n't changed . \\n i had . \\n `` you have to go to school , '' sam said , and if i had n't known him , i would n't have heard the hopeful questioning note . \\n i wondered where he would go while i was sitting in class . \\n `` i know , '' i replied , frowning at the multicolored sweaters and scarves trailing into the school , evidence of winter 's approach . \\n `` it just seems so ... '' what it seemed was irrelevant , disconnected from my life . \\n it was hard to remember what was important about sitting in a classroom with a stack of notes that would be meaningless by next year . \\n beside me , sam jumped in surprise as the driver 's - side door came open . \\n rachel climbed into the bronco with her backpack , shoving me across the bench seat to make room for herself . \\n she slammed the door shut and let out a big sigh . \\n the car seemed very full with her in it . \\n `` nice truck . '' \\n she leaned forward and looked over at sam . \\n `` ooh , a boy . \\n hi , boy ! \\n grace , i 'm so hyper . \\n coffee ! \\n are you mad at me ? '' \\n i leaned back in surprise , blinking . \\n `` no ? '' \\n `` good ! \\n because when you did n't call me in forever , i figured you 'd either died or were mad at me . \\n and you 're obviously not dead , so i thought it was the mad thing . '' \\n she drummed her fingers on the steering wheel . \\n `` but you are pissed at olivia , right ? '' \\n `` yes , '' i said , although i was n't sure if it was still true . \\n i remembered why we fought , but i could n't really remember why it had been meaningful . \\n `` no . \\n i do n't think so . \\n it was stupid . '' \\n `` yeah , i thought so , '' rachel said . \\n she leaned forward and rested her chin on the steering wheel so that she could look at sam . \\n `` so , boy , why are you in grace 's car ? '' \\n despite myself , i smiled . \\n i knew what sam was needed to be a secret , but sam himself did n't have to be , did he ? \\n i was suddenly filled with the need for rachel to approve of him . \\n `` yeah , boy , '' i said , craning my neck to see sam right beside me . \\n he wore an expression caught somewhere between amusement and doubt . \\n `` why are you in my car ? '' \\n `` i 'm here for visual interest , '' sam said . \\n `` wow , '' rachel replied . \\n `` like , long-term , or short-term ? '' \\n `` for as long as i 'm interesting . '' \\n he turned his face into my shoulder for a moment in a wordless gesture of affection . \\n i tried not to smile like an idiot . \\n `` oh , it 's that way , is it ? \\n well , then , i 'm rachel , and i 'm hyper , and i 'm grace 's best friend , '' she said , and stuck her hand out to him . \\n she was wearing rainbow-colored fingerless gloves that stretched up to her elbows . \\n sam shook her hand . \\n `` sam . '' \\n `` nice to meet you , sam . \\n do you go here ? '' \\n when he shook his head , rachel took my hand and said , `` yeah , i did n't think so . \\n well , then , i 'm going to steal this nice person from you and take her to class because we 're going to be late and i have lots of stuff to talk to her about and she 's missed out on so much freaky wolf stuff because she 's not talking to her other best friend . \\n so you can see we have to go . \\n i would say i 'm not normally this hyper , but i kinda am . \\n let 's go , grace ! '' \\n sam and i exchanged looks , his eyes fleetingly worried , and then rachel opened the door and pulled me out . \\n sam slid behind the wheel . \\n for a second i thought he might kiss me good-bye , but instead he glanced at rachel before resting his fingers on my hand for a moment . \\n his cheeks were pink . \\n rachel did n't say anything , but she smiled crookedly before pulling me toward the school . \\n she wiggled my arm . \\n `` so that 's why you have n't been calling , huh ? \\n the boy is supercute . \\n what 's he , homeschooled ? '' \\n as we pushed through the school doors , i looked over my shoulder at the bronco . \\n i saw sam lift a hand in a wave before he started to back out of the parking space . \\n `` yeah , he is , on both counts , '' i said . \\n `` more on that later . \\n what is going on with the wolves ? '' \\n rachel dramatically clutched her arms around my shoulders . \\n `` olivia saw one . \\n it was up on their front porch and there were claw marks , grace . \\n on the door . \\n creep . \\n factor . '' \\n i halted in the middle of the hallway ; students behind us made irritated noises and pushed around us . \\n i said , `` wait . \\n at olivia 's house ? '' \\n `` no , at your mom 's . '' \\n rachel shook her head and peeled off her rainbow gloves . \\n `` yes , at olivia 's house . \\n if you guys would stop fighting , she could tell you herself . \\n what are you fighting about , anyway ? \\n it pains me to see my peeps not playing nice with each other . '' \\n `` i told you , it 's just stupid stuff , '' i said . \\n i kind of wanted her to stop talking so i could try and think about the wolf at olivia 's house . \\n was it jack again ? \\n why at olivia 's ? \\n `` well , you guys need to start getting along because i want you both to go with me over christmas break . \\n and that 's not that far off , you know . \\n i mean , not really , once you start planning stuff . \\n come on , grace , just say yes ! '' \\n rachel wailed . \\n `` maybe . '' \\n it was n't really the wolf at olivia 's that bothered me . \\n it was the claw marks bit . \\n i needed to talk to olivia and find out how much of this was real and how much of it was rachel 's love of a good story . \\n `` is this about the boy ? \\n he can come ! \\n i do n't care ! '' \\n rachel said . \\n the hall was slowly emptying ; the bell rang overhead . \\n `` we 'll talk about it later ! '' \\n i said , and hurried with rachel into first period . \\n i found my usual seat and began sorting through my homework . \\n `` we need to talk . '' \\n i jerked to attention at the sound of an entirely different voice : isabel culpeper 's . \\n she slid her giant cork heels the rest of the way under the other desk and leaned toward me , highlighted hair framing her face in perfect , shiny ringlets . \\n `` we 're sort of in class right now , isabel , '' i said , gesturing toward the taped morning announcements playing on the tv at the front of the classroom . \\n the teacher was already at the front of the class , bent over her desk . \\n she was n't paying attention , but i still was n't thrilled with the idea of a conversation with isabel . \\n best-case scenario was that she needed help with her homework or something ; i had a reputation for being good at math , so it was sort of possible . \\n worst case was that she wanted to talk about jack . \\n sam had said that the only rule the pack had was that they did n't talk about werewolves to outsiders . \\n i was n't about to break that rule . \\n isabel 's face was still wearing a pretty pout , but i saw storms destroying small villages in her eyes . \\n she glanced toward the front of the room and leaned closer to me . \\n i smelled perfume-roses and summer in this minnesota cold . \\n `` it will only take a second . '' \\n i looked over at rachel , who was frowning at isabel . \\n i really did n't want to talk to isabel . \\n i did n't really know much about her , but i knew she was a dangerous gossip who could quickly reduce my standing in the school to cafeteria target practice . \\n i was n't really one who tried to be popular , but i remembered what had happened to the last girl who had gotten on isabel 's bad side . \\n she was still trying to get out from under a convoluted rumor that involved lap dancing and the football team . \\n `` why ? '' \\n `` privately , '' hissed isabel . \\n `` across the hall . '' \\n i rolled my eyes as i pushed out of my desk and tiptoed out the back of the room . \\n rachel gave me a brief , pained look . \\n i was sure i wore a matching one . \\n `` two seconds . \\n that 's it , '' i told isabel as she shuffled me across the hall into an empty classroom . \\n the corkboard on the opposite wall was covered with anatomical drawings ; someone had pinned a thong over one of the figures . \\n `` yeah . \\n whatever . '' \\n she shut the door behind us and eyed me as if i would spontaneously break into song or something . \\n i did n't know what she was waiting for . \\n i crossed my arms . \\n `` okay . \\n what do you want ? '' \\n i 'd thought i was prepared for it , but when she said , `` my brother . \\n jack , '' my heart still raced . \\n i did n't say anything . \\n `` i saw him while i was running this morning . '' \\n i swallowed . \\n `` your brother . '' \\n isabel pointed at me with a perfect nail , glossier than the hood of the bronco . \\n her ringlets bounced . \\n `` oh , do n't give me that . \\n i talked to him . \\n he 's not dead . '' \\n i briefly wrestled with the image of isabel jogging . \\n i could n't see it . \\n maybe she meant running from her chihuahua . \\n `` um . '' \\n isabel pressed on . \\n `` there was something screwed up with him . \\n and do n't say ` that 's because he 's dead . ' \\n he 's not . '' \\n something about isabel 's charming personality-and maybe the fact that i knew jack was actually alive-made it very difficult to empathize with her . \\n i said , `` isabel , it seems to me like you do n't need me to have this conversation . \\n you 're doing a great job all by yourself . '' \\n `` shut up , '' isabel said , which only supported my theory . \\n i was about to tell her so , but her next words stopped me cold . \\n `` when i saw jack , he said he had n't really died . \\n then he started-twitching-and said he had to go right then . \\n when i tried to ask him what was wrong with him , he said that you knew . '' \\n my voice came out a little strangled sounding . \\n `` me ? '' \\n but i remembered his eyes imploring me as he lay pinned beneath the she-wolf . \\n help me . \\n he had recognized me . \\n `` well , it 's not exactly a shock , is it ? \\n everyone knows that you and olivia marx are freaks for those wolves , and clearly this has something to do with them . \\n so what 's going on , grace ? '' \\n i did n't like the way she asked the question-like maybe she already knew the answer . \\n blood was rushing in my ears ; i was in way over my head . \\n `` look . \\n you 're upset , i get that . \\n but seriously , get help . \\n leave me and olivia out of this . \\n i do n't know what you saw , but it was n't jack . '' \\n the lie left a bad taste in my mouth . \\n i could see the reasoning behind the pack 's secrecy , but jack was isabel 's brother . \\n did n't she have a right to know ? \\n `` i was n't seeing things , '' isabel snapped as i opened the door . \\n `` i 'm going to find him again . \\n and i 'm going to find out what your part is in all this . '' \\n `` i do n't have a part , '' i said . \\n `` i just like the wolves . \\n now i need to get to class . '' \\n isabel stood in the doorway , watching me go , and i wondered what , at the beginning of all this , she had thought i was going to say . \\n she looked almost forlorn , or maybe it was just an act . \\n in any case , i said , `` isabel , just get help . '' \\n she crossed her arms . \\n `` i thought that 's what i was doing . '' \\n chapter twenty-nine sam 54of while grace was at school , i spent a long time in the parking lot , thinking about meeting wild rachel and wondering what she 'd meant by the wolf comment . \\n i debated hunting for jack , but i wanted to hear what grace found out at school before i went on any wild-goose chase . \\n i did n't quite know how to occupy my time without grace and without my pack . \\n i felt like someone who has an hour until his bus arrives-not really enough time to do anything important , but too much time to just sit and wait . \\n the subtle cold bite behind the breeze told me that i could n't put off getting on my bus forever . \\n i finally drove the bronco to the post office . \\n i had the key to beck 's post office box , but mostly , what i wanted to do was conjure memories and pretend that i 'd run into him there . \\n i remembered the day beck had brought me there to pick up my books for school-even now , i remembered it had been a tuesday , because back then , tuesdays were my favorite day . \\n i do n't remember why-it was just something about the way that u looked like when it was next to e that seemed very friendly . \\n i always loved going to the post office with beck ; it was a treasure cave with rows and rows of little locked boxes holding secrets and surprises only for those with the proper key . \\n with peculiar clarity , i remembered that conversation clearly , down to the expression on beck 's face : `` sam . \\n come on , bucko . '' \\n `` what 's that ? '' \\n beck shoved his back ineffectually against the glass door , suffering under the weight of a huge box . \\n `` your brain . '' \\n `` i already have a brain . '' \\n `` if you did , you 'd have opened the door for me . '' \\n i shot him a dark look and let him shove against the door a moment longer before i ducked under his arms to push it open . \\n `` what is it really ? '' \\n `` schoolbooks . \\n we 're going to educate you properly , so you do n't grow up to be an idiot . '' \\n i remembered being intrigued by the idea of school-in-a-box , just-add-water-and-sam . \\n the rest of the pack was equally intrigued . \\n i was the first in the pack to be bitten before finishing school , so the novelty of educating me was fascinating to the others . \\n for several summers , they all took turns with the massive lesson manual and the lovely , ink-smelling new textbooks . \\n they would stuff my brain full all day long : ulrik for math ; beck for history ; paul for vocabulary , and later , science . \\n they shouted test questions at me across the dinner table , invented songs for the timelines of dead presidents , and converted one of the dining room walls into a giant whiteboard that was always written with words of the day and dirty jokes that no one would cop to . \\n when i was done with the first box of books , beck packed them up and another box came to take its place . \\n when i was n't studying my school-in-a-box , i was surfing the internet for a different sort of education . \\n i surfed for photos of circus freaks and synonyms for the word intercourse and for answers to why staring at the stars in the evening tore my heart with longing . \\n with the third box of books came a new pack member : shelby , a tanned , slender girl covered in bruises and stumbling under the weight of a heavy southern accent . \\n i remembered beck telling paul , `` i could n't just leave her there . \\n god ! \\n paul , you did n't see where she came from . \\n you did n't see what they were doing to her . '' \\n i 'd felt sorry for shelby , who 'd made herself inaccessible to the others . \\n i 'd been the only one who had managed to float a life raft to the island that was shelby , coaxing words out of her and , sometimes , a smile . \\n she was strange , a breakable animal that would do anything to reassert control over her life . \\n she 'd steal things from beck so that he would have to ask where they 'd gone , play with the thermostat to watch paul get up from the couch to fix it , hide my books so that i would talk with her instead of reading . \\n but we were all broken in that house , were n't we ? \\n after all , i was the kid who could n't bear to look into a bathroom . \\n beck had picked up another box of books from the post office for shelby , but they did n't mean the same thing to her that they did to me . \\n she left them to collect dust and looked up wolf behavior online instead . \\n now , here in the post office , i stopped in front of beck 's p.o. box , 730 . \\n i touched the chipped paint of the numbers ; the three was nearly gone and had been for as long as i 'd been coming here . \\n i put the key into the box , but i did n't turn it . \\n was it so wrong to want this so bad ? \\n an ordinary life of ordinary years with grace , a couple of decades of turning keys in p.o. boxes and lying in bed and putting up christmas trees in winter ? \\n and now i was thinking of shelby , again , and the memories bit , sharp as cold next to memories of grace . \\n shelby had always thought my attachment to my human life was ludicrous . \\n i still remembered the worst fight we had about it . \\n not the first , or the last , but the most cruel . \\n i was lying on my bed , reading a copy of yeats that ulrik had bought for me , and shelby jumped onto the mattress and stepped on the pages of the book , wrinkling them beneath her bare foot . \\n `` come listen to the howls i found online , '' she said . \\n `` i 'm reading . '' \\n `` mine 's more important , '' shelby said , towering above me , her toes curling and crinkling the pages further . \\n `` why do you bother reading that stuff ? '' \\n she gestured to the stack of schoolbooks on the desk beside my bed . \\n `` that 's not what you 're going to be when you grow up . \\n you 're not going to be a man . \\n you 're going to be a wolf , so you should be learning wolf things . '' \\n `` shut up , '' i said . \\n `` well , it 's true . \\n you 're not going to be sam . \\n all those books are a waste . \\n you 're going to be alpha male . \\n i read about that . \\n and i 'll be your mate . \\n the alpha female . '' \\n her face was excited , flushed . \\n shelby wanted nothing more than to leave her past behind . \\n i ripped yeats out from beneath her foot and smoothed the page . \\n `` i will be sam . \\n i 'm never going to stop being sam . '' \\n `` you wo n't be ! '' \\n shelby 's voice was getting louder . \\n she jumped off my bed and shoved my stack of books over ; thousands of words crashed onto the floor . \\n `` this is just pretending ! \\n we wo n't have names , we 'll just be wolves ! '' \\n i shouted , `` shut up ! \\n i can still be sam when i 'm a wolf ! '' \\n beck burst into the room , then , looking at the scene in his silent way : my books , my life , my dreams , spread under shelby 's feet , and me on my bed , clutching my wrinkled yeats in white-knuckled hands . \\n `` what 's going on here ? '' \\n beck said . \\n shelby jerked a finger at me . \\n `` tell him ! \\n tell him he 's not going to be sam anymore , when we 're wolves . \\n he ca n't be . \\n he wo n't even know his name . \\n and i wo n't be shelby . '' \\n she was shaking , furious . \\n beck 's voice was so quiet i could barely hear him . \\n `` sam will always be sam . '' \\n he took shelby 's upper arm and marched her out of the room , her feet skidding on my books . \\n her face was shocked ; beck had been careful to never lay a hand on her since she 'd come . \\n i 'd never seen him so angry . \\n `` do n't you ever tell him differently , shelby . \\n or i will take you back where you came from . \\n i will take you back . '' \\n in the hallway , shelby began to scream , and she did n't stop until beck slammed her bedroom door . \\n he walked back past my room and paused in the doorway . \\n i was gently stacking my books back on the desk . \\n the words shook in my hands as i did . \\n i thought beck would say something , but he just picked up a book by his feet and added it to my pile before he left . \\n later , i heard ulrik and beck ; they did n't realize there were n't many places in the house a werewolf could n't hear . \\n `` you were too hard on shelby , '' ulrik said . \\n `` she has a point . \\n what is it you think he 's going to do with all this wonderful book learning , beck ? \\n it 's not as if he 'll ever be able to do what you do . '' \\n there was a long pause and ulrik said , `` what , you ca n't be surprised . \\n it does n't take a genius to figure out what you were thinking . \\n but tell me , how did you think sam would go to college ? '' \\n another pause . \\n beck said , `` summer school . \\n and some online credits . '' \\n `` right . \\n let 's say sam gets his degree . \\n what 's he going to do with it ? \\n go to law school online , too ? \\n and then what kind of lawyer would he be ? \\n people put up with your eccentric gone-for - the-winter routine because you were established when you were bitten . \\n sam will have to try to get jobs that ignore his unscheduled disappearance every year . \\n for all the learning you 're stuffing in his head , he 's going to have to get jobs at gas stations like the rest of us . \\n if he even makes it past twenty . '' \\n `` you want to tell him to give up ? \\n you tell him . \\n i 'll never tell him that . '' \\n `` i 'm not telling him to give up . \\n i 'm telling you to give up . '' \\n `` sam does n't do anything he does n't want to . \\n he wants to learn . \\n he 's smart . '' \\n `` beck . \\n you 're going to make him miserable . \\n you ca n't give him all the tools to succeed and then let him discover-poof-that he ca n't use any of them . \\n shelby 's right . \\n in the end , we 're wolves . \\n i can read him german poetry and paul can teach him about past participles and you can play mozart for him , but in the end , it 's a long , cold night and those woods for all of us . '' \\n another pause before beck answered , sounding tired and unlike himself . \\n `` just leave me alone , ulrik , okay ? \\n just leave me alone . '' \\n the next day beck told me i did n't have to do my schoolwork if i did n't want to , and he went driving by himself . \\n i waited until he was gone , and then i did the work , anyway . \\n now , i wished more than anything that beck was here with me . \\n i turned the key in the lock , knowing what i 'd find-a box stuffed with months ' worth of envelopes and probably a slip to collect more from behind the desk . \\n but when i opened the box , there were two lonely letters and some junk fliers . \\n someone had been here . \\n recently . \\n chapter thirty sam 41of `` do you mind if i go by olivia 's ? '' \\n grace asked , climbing into the car , bringing in a rush of cold air with her . \\n in the passenger seat , i recoiled , and she hurriedly shut the door behind her . \\n she said , `` sorry about that . \\n it got really cold , did n't it ? \\n anyway , i do n't want to , you know , actually go inside . \\n just drive by . \\n rachel said that a wolf had been scratching around olivia 's house . \\n so maybe we could pick up a trail near there ? '' \\n `` go for it , '' i said . \\n taking her hand from where it rested , i kissed her fingertips before replacing it on the wheel . \\n i slouched down in my seat and got my translation of rilke i 'd brought to read while i waited for her . \\n grace 's lips lifted slightly at my touch , but she did n't say anything as she pulled out of the lot . \\n i watched her face , etched into concentration , mouth set in a firm line , and waited to see if she was ready to say what was on her mind . \\n when she did n't , i picked up the volume of rilke and slouched down in my seat . \\n `` what are you reading ? '' \\n grace asked , after a long space of silence . \\n i was fairly certain that pragmatic grace would not have heard of rilke . \\n `` poetry . '' \\n grace sighed and gazed out at the dead white sky that seemed to press down on the road before us . \\n `` i do n't get poetry . '' \\n she seemed to realize her statement might offend , because she hurriedly added , `` maybe i 'm reading the wrong stuff . '' \\n `` you 're probably just reading it wrong , '' i said . \\n i 'd seen grace 's to-be-read pile : nonfiction , books about things , not about how things were described . \\n `` you have to listen to the pattern of the words , not just what they 're saying . \\n like a song . '' \\n when she frowned , i paged through my book and scooted closer to her on the bench seat , so that our hip bones were pressed together . \\n grace glanced down at the page . \\n `` that 's not even in english ! '' \\n `` some of them are , '' i said . \\n i sighed , remembering . \\n `` ulrik was using rilke to teach me german . \\n and now i 'm going to use it to teach you poetry . '' \\n `` clearly a foreign language , '' grace said . \\n `` clearly , '' i agreed . \\n `` listen to this . \\n ` was soll ich mit meinem munde ? \\n mit meiner nacht ? \\n mit meinem tag ? \\n ich habe keine geliebte , kein haus , keine stelle auf der ich lebe . ' '' \\n grace 's face was puzzled . \\n she chewed her lip in a cute , frustrated sort of way . \\n `` so what 's it mean ? '' \\n `` that 's not the point . \\n the point is what it sounds like . \\n not just what it means . '' \\n i struggled to find words for what i meant . \\n what i wanted to do was remind her of how she 'd fallen in love with me as a wolf . \\n without words . \\n seeing beyond the obvious meaning of my wolfskin to what was inside . \\n to whatever it was that made me sam , always . \\n `` read it again , '' grace said . \\n i read it again . \\n she tapped her fingers against the steering wheel . \\n `` it sounds sad , '' she said . \\n `` you 're smiling-i must be right . '' \\n i flipped to the english translation . '' \\n ` what then would i do with my lips ? \\n with my night ? \\n with my day ? \\n i have no ' - bah . \\n i do n't like this translation . \\n i 'm going to get my other one from the house tomorrow . \\n but yeah , it 's sad . '' \\n `` do i get a prize ? '' \\n `` maybe , '' i said , and slid my hand underneath one of hers , twining our fingers . \\n without looking away from the road , she lifted our tangled fingers to her mouth . \\n she kissed my index finger and then put it between her teeth , biting down softly . \\n she glanced over at me , her eyes holding an unspoken challenge . \\n i was completely caught . \\n i wanted to tell her to pull over right then because i needed to kiss her . \\n but then i saw a wolf . \\n `` grace . \\n stop-stop the car ! '' \\n she jerked her head around , trying to see what i saw , but the wolf had already jumped the ditch on the side of the road and headed into the sparse woods . \\n `` grace , stop , '' i said . \\n `` jack . '' \\n she hit the brakes ; the bronco shimmied back and forth as she guided it to the shoulder . \\n i did n't wait for the car to stop . \\n just shoved open the door and stumbled out , my ankles crying out as i slammed onto the frozen ground . \\n i scanned the woods in front of me . \\n clouds of sharp-smelling smoke drifted through the trees , mingling with the heavy white clouds that pushed down from above ; someone was burning leaves on the other side of the woods . \\n through the smoke , i saw the blue-gray wolf hesitating in the woods ahead of me , not sure he was being pursued . \\n cold air clawed at my skin , and the wolf looked over his shoulder at me . \\n hazel eyes . \\n jack . \\n it had to be . \\n and then he was gone , just like that , plunging into the smoke . \\n i jumped after him , taking the ditch by the side of the road in one leap and running over the cold , hard stubble of the dying winter woods . \\n as i leaped into the forest , i heard jack crashing ahead of me , more interested in escape than stealth . \\n i could smell the stink of fear as he bolted ahead of me . \\n the wood smoke was heavier here , and it was hard to tell where the smoke ended and the sky began , snared in the bare branches overhead . \\n jack was half-invisible in front of me , faster and nimbler than me on his four legs , and impervious to the cold . \\n my fingers , half-numb , stabbed with pain , and cold pinched the skin of my neck and twisted my gut . \\n i was losing sight of the wolf ahead of me ; the one inside me seemed closer all of a sudden . \\n `` sam ! '' \\n grace shouted . \\n she grabbed the back of my shirt , pulling me to a stop , and threw her coat around me . \\n i was coughing , gasping for air and trying to swallow the wolf rising up in me . \\n wrapping her arms around me as i shuddered , she said , `` what were you thinking ? \\n what were you - '' she did n't finish . \\n she pulled me back through the woods , both of us stumbling , my knees buckling . \\n i slowed , especially when we got to the ditch , but grace did n't falter , hooking my elbow to haul me up to the bronco . \\n inside , i buried my cold face into the hot skin of her neck and let her wrap her arms around me as i shook uncontrollably . \\n i was acutely aware of the tips of my fingers , of each little pinprick of pain throbbing individually . \\n `` what were you doing ? '' \\n grace demanded , squeezing me hard enough to force the breath out of me . \\n `` sam , you ca n't do that ! \\n it 's freezing out there ! \\n what did you think you were going to do ? '' \\n `` i do n't know , '' i said into her neck , balling my hands into fists between us to get them warm . \\n i did n't know . \\n i just knew that jack was an unknown , and that i did n't know what kind of person he was , what sort of a wolf he was . \\n `` i do n't know , '' i said again . \\n `` sam , it 's not worth it , '' grace said , and she pressed her face , hard , against my head . \\n `` what if you 'd changed ? '' \\n her fingers were tight on the sleeves of my shirt , and now her voice was breathy . \\n `` what were you thinking ? '' \\n `` i was n't , '' i said , truthfully . \\n i sat back , finally warm enough to stop shivering . \\n i pressed my hands against the heating vents . \\n `` i 'm sorry . '' \\n for a long moment , there was n't any sound but the uneven rumbling of the idling engine . \\n then grace said , `` isabel talked to me today . \\n she 's jack 's sister . '' \\n she paused . \\n `` she said she 'd talked to him . '' \\n i did n't say anything , just curled my fingers tighter over the vents as if i could physically grab the heat . \\n `` but you ca n't just go running after him . \\n it 's getting too cold , and it 's not worth the risk . \\n promise me you wo n't do anything like that again ? '' \\n i dropped my eyes . \\n i could n't look at her when she sounded like she did now . \\n i said , `` what about isabel ? \\n tell me what she said . '' \\n grace sighed . \\n `` i do n't know . \\n she knows jack 's alive . \\n she thinks the wolves have something to do with it . \\n she thinks i know something . \\n what should we do ? '' \\n i pressed my forehead against my hands . \\n `` i do n't know . \\n i wish beck were here . '' \\n i thought about the two lonely envelopes in the post office box and the wolf in the woods and my still-tingling fingertips . \\n maybe beck was here . \\n hope hurt more than the cold . \\n maybe it was n't jack i should 've been looking for . \\n chapter thirty-one sam 53of once i 'd let myself think that beck might still be human , the idea possessed me . \\n i slept badly , my mind skipping over all the ways i could try to track him down . \\n doubts crowded in there , too-it could 've been any of the pack members that had gotten the mail or bought milk-but i could n't help it . \\n hope won over all of it . \\n at breakfast the next morning , i chatted with grace about her calculus homework-it looked entirely incomprehensible to me-and about her rich , hyper friend rachel and about whether or not turtles had teeth , but really , what i was thinking about was beck . \\n after i dropped grace off at school , i tried for a brief moment to pretend that i was n't heading straight back to beck 's house . \\n he was n't there . \\n i already knew that . \\n but it could n't hurt to just check again . \\n on the way over , i kept thinking about what grace had said the other night about the electricity and the milk in the fridge . \\n maybe , just maybe , beck would be there , relieving me of the responsibility of jack and eliminating the unbearable weight of being the last one of my kind . \\n even if the house was still empty , i could still get some more clothing and my other copy of rilke and walk through the rooms , smelling the memories of kinship . \\n i remembered three short years ago , back when more of us were in our prime , able to return to our real , human forms at the first kiss of spring 's warmth . \\n the house was full then-paul , shelby , ulrik , beck , derek , and even crazy salem were human at the same time . \\n spiraling through insanity together made it seem more sane . \\n i slowed as i headed down beck 's road , my heart jumping as i saw a vehicle pulling into his driveway , and then sinking when i saw that it was an unfamiliar tahoe . \\n brake lights glowed dully in the gray day , and i rolled down my window to try and catch a bit of scent . \\n before i 'd caught anything , i heard the driver 's - side door open and shut on the far side of the suv . \\n then the breeze played the driver 's scent right to me , clean and vaguely smoky . \\n beck . \\n i parked the bronco on the side of the road and jumped out , grinning as i saw him come around the side of the suv . \\n his eyes widened for a moment , and then he grinned , too , an expression that his smile-lined face fell into easily . \\n `` sam ! '' \\n beck 's voice held something weird-surprise , i think . \\n his grin widened . \\n `` sam , thank god . \\n come here ! '' \\n he hugged me and patted my back in that touchy-feely way that he always managed to pull off without seeming gropey . \\n must 've come from being a lawyer ; he knew how to schmooze people . \\n i could n't help but notice that he was wider around the middle ; not from fat . \\n i do n't know how many shirts he must 've been wearing underneath his coat to keep himself warm enough to be human , but i saw the mismatched collars of at least two . \\n `` where have you been ? '' \\n `` i - '' i was about to tell him the whole story in a nutshell of getting shot , meeting grace , seeing jack , but i did n't . \\n i do n't know why i did n't . \\n certainly it was n't because of beck , who was watching me earnestly with his intense blue eyes . \\n it was something , some strange scent , faint but familiar , that was making my muscles clench and pasting my tongue to the top of my mouth . \\n this was n't how it was supposed to be . \\n it was n't supposed to feel like this . \\n my answer came out more guarded than i 'd intended . \\n `` i 've been around . \\n not here . \\n you were n't here , either , i noticed . '' \\n `` nope , '' beck admitted . \\n he headed around to the back of the tahoe . \\n i noticed then that the van was filthy-thick with dirt . \\n dirt that smelled of somewhere else , stuffed up into the wheel wells and splattered along the fenders . \\n `` salem and i were up in canada . '' \\n so that 's why i had n't seen salem anywhere recently . \\n salem had always been problematic : he was n't quite right as a human , so he was n't quite right when he was a wolf , either . \\n i was pretty sure salem was the one who had dragged grace from her swing . \\n how beck had managed a car trip with him was beyond me . \\n why he managed a car trip with him was even further beyond me . \\n `` you smell like hospital . '' \\n beck squinted at me . \\n `` and you look like hell . '' \\n `` thanks , '' i said . \\n guess i was telling after all . \\n i really did n't think the hospital smell could still linger after a week , but beck 's wrinkled nose said otherwise . \\n `` i was shot . '' \\n beck pushed his fingers against his lips and spoke through them . \\n `` god . \\n where ? \\n nowhere that 'd make me blush , i hope . '' \\n i gestured to my neck . \\n `` nowhere near that interesting . '' \\n `` is everything okay ? '' \\n he meant were we still okay ? \\n did anybody know ? \\n there 's a girl . \\n she 's amazing . \\n she knows , but it 's okay . \\n i tried out the words in my head , but there was n't any way to make them sound all right . \\n i just kept hearing beck tell me how we could n't trust our secret with anyone but us . \\n so i just shrugged . \\n `` as okay as we ever are . '' \\n and then my stomach dropped out from under me . \\n he was going to smell grace in the house . \\n `` god , sam , '' beck said . \\n `` why did n't you call my cell ? \\n when you were shot ? '' \\n `` i do n't have your number . \\n for this year 's phone . '' \\n every year , we got new phones , since we did n't use them over the winter . \\n another look that i did n't like . \\n sympathy . \\n no , pity . \\n i pretended not to see it . \\n beck fumbled in his pocket and pulled out a cell phone . \\n `` here , take this . \\n it 's salem 's . \\n like he 's going to use it anymore . '' \\n `` bark once for yes , twice for no ? '' \\n beck grinned . \\n `` exactly . \\n anyway , it 's got my number in its brain already . \\n so use it . \\n you might have to buy a charger for it . '' \\n i thought he was about to ask me where i 'd been staying , and i did n't want to answer . \\n so instead i jerked my chin toward the tahoe . \\n `` so why all the dirt ? \\n why the trip ? '' \\n i knocked a fist on the side of the car , and to my surprise , something knocked back inside . \\n more like a thud . \\n like a kick . \\n i raised an eyebrow . \\n `` is salem in here ? '' \\n `` he 's back in the woods . \\n he changed in canada , the bastard , i had to bring him back like that and he sheds like it 's going out of style . \\n and you know , i think he 's crazy . '' \\n beck and i both laughed at that-as if that needed to be said . \\n i looked back to the place where i 'd felt the thump against my fist . \\n `` so what 's thumping ? '' \\n beck raised his eyebrows . \\n `` the future . \\n want to see ? '' \\n i shrugged and stepped back so he could open the doors to the back . \\n if i thought i was prepared for what was inside , i was wrong in about forty different ways . \\n the backseats of the tahoe were folded down to make more room , and inside the extended trunk were three bodies . \\n humans . \\n one was sitting awkwardly against the back of the seats , one was curled into a fetal position , and the other lay crookedly alongside the door . \\n their hands were all zip tied . \\n i stared , and the boy sitting against the seats stared back , his eyes bloodshot . \\n my age , maybe a little younger . \\n red was smeared along his arms , and i saw now that it continued all over the inside of the vehicle . \\n and then i smelled them : the metallic stink of blood , the sweaty odor of fear , the earthy scent that matched the dirt on the outside of the tahoe . \\n and wolf , wolf , everywhere-beck , salem , and unfamiliar wolves . \\n the girl curled into a ball was shuddering , and when i squinted at the boy , staring back at me in the darkness , i saw that he was shivering , too , his fingers clenching and unclenching one another in a tangled knot of fear . \\n `` help , '' he said . \\n i fell back , several feet into the driveway , my knees weak beneath me . \\n i covered my mouth , then came closer to stare at them . \\n the boy 's eyes pleaded . \\n i was vaguely aware that beck was standing nearby , just watching me , but i could n't stop looking back at those kids . \\n my voice did n't sound like mine . \\n `` no . \\n no . \\n these kids have been bitten . \\n beck , they 've been bitten . '' \\n i spun , laced my hands behind my head , spun back to look at the three of them again . \\n the boy shuddered violently , but his eyes never left mine . \\n help . \\n `` oh , hell , beck . \\n what have you done ? \\n what the hell have you done ? '' \\n `` are you finished yet ? '' \\n beck asked calmly . \\n i turned again , squeezing my eyes shut and then open again . \\n `` finished ? \\n how can i be finished ? \\n beck , these kids are changing . '' \\n `` i 'm not going to talk to you until you 're done . '' \\n `` beck , are you seeing this ? '' \\n i leaned against the tahoe , looking in at the girl , fingers clawed into the bloodstained carpet of the back . \\n she was maybe eighteen , wearing a tight tie-dyed shirt . \\n i pushed off , backing away , as if that would make them disappear . \\n `` what is going on ? '' \\n in the back of the car , the boy began to groan , pushing his face into his bound wrists . \\n his skin was dusky as he began to change in earnest . \\n i turned away . \\n i could n't watch . \\n not remembering what it was like , those first days . \\n i just kept my fingers laced behind my head and pressed my arms against my ears like a vise grip , saying , oh hell oh hell oh hell , over and over until i convinced myself i could n't hear his wails . \\n they were n't even calls for help ; maybe he already sensed that beck 's house was too isolated for anyone to hear him . \\n or maybe he 'd given up . \\n `` will you help me take them inside ? '' \\n beck asked . \\n i spun to face him , seeing a wolf stepping from the too-large zip ties and a shirt , growling and starting back as tie-dye-girl moaned at his feet . \\n in an instant , beck had leaped into the back of the suv , lithe and animal , and had thrown the wolf onto its back . \\n he grabbed its jaws with one hand and stared into the wolf 's eyes . \\n `` do n't even think of fighting , '' he snarled at the wolf . \\n `` you are n't in charge here . '' \\n beck dropped the wolf 's muzzle , and its head hit the carpet with a dull thud , unprotesting . \\n the wolf was beginning to shake again ; already getting ready to change back again . \\n god . \\n i could n't watch this . \\n it was as bad as going through it myself all over again , never sure which skin i 'd be wearing . \\n i looked away , to beck . \\n `` you did this on purpose , did n't you ? '' \\n beck sat on the tailgate as if there was n't a spasming wolf behind him and a wailing girl beside him . \\n and that other one-still not moving . \\n dead ? \\n `` sam , it 's probably my last year . \\n i do n't think i 'll change next year . \\n it took a lot of quick thinking this year to keep myself human once i finally had changed . '' \\n he saw my eyes looking at the different-colored collars at his neck and he nodded . \\n `` we need this house . \\n the pack needs this house . \\n and the pack needs protectors still able to change . \\n you already know . \\n we ca n't rely on humans . \\n we are the only ones who can protect us . '' \\n i did n't say anything . \\n he sighed heavily . \\n `` this is your last year , too , is n't it , sam ? \\n i did n't think you would change at all this year . \\n you were still a wolf when i changed , and it should 've been the other way around . \\n i do n't know why you got so few years . \\n maybe because of what your parents did to you . \\n it 's a damn shame . \\n you 're the best of them . '' \\n i did n't say anything , because i had no breath to say it with . \\n all i could focus on was how his hair had a little bit of blood in it . \\n i had n't noticed it before , because his hair was dark auburn , but the blood had dried just one lock into a stiff cowlick . \\n `` sam , who was supposed to watch over the pack , huh ? \\n shelby ? \\n we had to have more wolves . \\n more wolves at the beginning of their years , so this is n't a problem again for another eight or ten years . '' \\n i stared at the blood in his hair . \\n my voice was dull . \\n `` what about jack ? '' \\n `` the kid with the gun ? '' \\n beck grimaced . \\n `` we can thank salem and shelby for that . \\n i ca n't go looking for him . \\n it 's too cold . \\n he 's going to have to find us . \\n i just hope to hell he does n't do anything stupid before then . \\n hopefully , he 'll have the brains god gave him and stay away from people until he 's stable . '' \\n beside him , the girl screamed , a high , thin wail lacking any force , and between one shudder and the next , her skin was the creamy blue of a black wolf 's . \\n her shoulders rippled , arms forcing her upward , onto new toes where fingers had been . \\n i remembered the pain as clearly as if i were shifting-the pain of loss . \\n i felt the agony of the single moment that i lost myself . \\n lost what made me sam . \\n the part of me that could remember grace 's name . \\n i rubbed a tear out of one of my eyes , watching her struggle . \\n part of me wanted to shake beck for doing this to them . \\n and part of me was just thinking , thank god grace never had to go through this . \\n `` beck , '' i said , blinking before looking at him . \\n `` you 're going to hell for this . '' \\n i did n't wait to see what his reaction was . \\n i just left . \\n i wished i 'd never come . \\n that night , like every other night since i 'd met her , i curled grace into my arms , listening to her parents ' muffled movements in the living room . \\n they were like busy little brainless birds , fluttering in and out of their nest at all hours of the day or night , so involved in the pleasure of nest building that they had n't noticed that it had been empty for years . \\n they were noisy , too , laughing , chatting , clattering dishes in the kitchen although i 'd never seen evidence of either of them cooking . \\n they were college kids who had found a baby in a rush basket and did n't know what to do with it . \\n how would grace have been different if she 'd had my family-the pack ? \\n if she 'd had beck . \\n in my head , i heard beck acknowledging what i 'd feared . \\n it really was true , that this was my last year . \\n i breathed , `` the end . '' \\n not really out loud . \\n just trying out the shape of the words in my mouth . \\n in the cautious fortress of my arms , grace sighed and pressed her face into my chest . \\n she was already asleep . \\n unlike me , who had to stalk sleep with poisoned arrows , grace could fall asleep in a second . \\n i envied her . \\n all i could see was beck and those kids , a thousand different permutations of the scene dancing before my eyes . \\n i wanted to tell grace about it . \\n i did n't want to tell her about it . \\n i was ashamed of beck , torn between loyalty to him and loyalty to me-and i had n't even realized until now they could be two different things . \\n i did n't want grace to think badly of him-but i wanted a confessional , someplace to put this unbearable weight in my chest . \\n `` go to sleep , '' she murmured , barely audible , hooking her fingers in my t-shirt in a way that did n't make me think of sleep . \\n i kissed her closed eyes and sighed . \\n she made an appreciative noise and whispered , eyes still closed , `` shh , sam . \\n whatever it is will keep till morning . \\n and if it does n't , it is n't worth it anyway . \\n sleep . '' \\n because she told me to , i could . \\n chapter thirty-two grace 45of the first thing sam said to me the next day was , `` it 's time to take you on a proper date . '' \\n actually , the very first thing he said was , `` your hair is all funky in the morning . '' \\n but the very first lucid thing he said -lrb- i refused to believe my hair looked funky in the morning -rrb- was the date statement . \\n it was a `` work day '' for the teachers at school , so we had the entire day to ourselves-which felt indulgent . \\n he said this while stirring some oatmeal and looking over his shoulder toward the front door . \\n even though my parents had disappeared early for some sort of business outing of my dad 's , sam still seemed worried that they would reappear and hunt him down with pitchforks . \\n i joined him at the counter and leaned against it , peering down into the pan . \\n i was n't thrilled by the prospect of oatmeal . \\n i had tried to make it before , and it had tasted very ... healthy . \\n `` so about this date . \\n where are you taking me ? \\n someplace exciting , like the middle of the woods ? '' \\n he pressed his finger against my lips , right where they parted . \\n he did n't smile . \\n `` on a normal date . \\n food and fun fun fun . '' \\n i turned my face so his hand was against my hair instead . \\n `` yeah , sounds like it , '' i said , sarcastically , because he still was n't smiling . \\n `` i did n't think you did normal . '' \\n `` get me two bowls , would you ? '' \\n sam said . \\n i set them on the counter and sam divided the oatmeal between them , releasing a sweet scent . \\n `` i just really want to do a proper date , so you 'll have something real to rem - '' he stopped and looked down into the bowls , arms braced against the counter , shoulders shrugged up by his ears . \\n finally , he turned and said , `` i want to do things right . \\n can we try to do normal ? '' \\n with a nod , i accepted one of the bowls and tried a spoonful-it was all brown sugar and maple and something sort of spicy . \\n i pointed an oatmeal-covered spoon at sam . \\n `` i have no problem doing normal . \\n this stuff is sticky . '' \\n `` ingrate , '' sam said . \\n he looked dolefully at his bowl . \\n `` you do n't like it . '' \\n `` it 's actually okay . '' \\n sam said , `` beck used to make it for me , after i got over my egg fixation . '' \\n `` you had an egg fixation ? '' \\n `` i was a peculiar child , '' sam said . \\n he gestured to my bowl . \\n `` you do n't have to eat it if you do n't like it . \\n when you 're done , we 'll go . '' \\n `` go where ? '' \\n `` surprise . '' \\n that was all i needed to hear . \\n that oatmeal was gone instantly and i had my hat , coat , and backpack in hand . \\n for the first time that morning , sam laughed , and i was ridiculously glad to hear it . \\n `` you look like a puppy . \\n like i 'm jingling my keys and you 're jumping by the door waiting for your walk . '' \\n `` woof . '' \\n sam patted my head on the way out and together we ventured into the cold pastel morning . \\n once we were in the bronco and on the road , i pressed again , `` so you wo n't tell me where we 're going ? '' \\n `` nope . \\n the only thing i 'll tell you is to pretend that this is what i did with you the first day i met you , instead of being shot . '' \\n `` i do n't have that much imagination . '' \\n `` i do . \\n i 'll imagine it for you , so strongly that you 'll have to believe it . '' \\n he smiled to demonstrate his imagining , a smile so sad that my breath caught in my throat . \\n `` i 'll court you properly and then it wo n't make my obsession with you so creepy . '' \\n `` seems to me that mine 's the creepy one . '' \\n i looked out the window as we pulled out of the driveway . \\n the sky was relinquishing one slow snowflake after another . \\n `` i have that , you know , what 's it called ? \\n that syndrome where you identify with the people who save you ? '' \\n sam shook his head and turned the opposite way from school . \\n `` you 're thinking of that munchausen syndrome , where the person identifies with their kidnapper . '' \\n i shook my head . \\n `` that 's not the same . \\n is n't munchausen when you invent sicknesses to get attention ? '' \\n `` is it ? \\n i just like saying ` munchausen . ' \\n i feel like i can actually speak german when i say it . '' \\n i laughed . \\n `` ulrik was born in germany , '' sam said . \\n `` he has all kinds of interesting children 's stories about werewolves . '' \\n he turned onto the main road through downtown and started looking for a parking space . \\n `` he said people would get bitten willingly , back in the old days . '' \\n i looked out the window at mercyfalls . \\n the shops , all shades of brown and gray , seemed even more brown and gray under the leaden sky , and for october , it felt ominously close to winter . \\n there were no green leaves left on the trees that grew by the side of the street , and some were missing their leaves entirely , adding to the bleak appearance of the town . \\n it was concrete as far as the eye could see . \\n `` why would they want to do that ? '' \\n `` in the folktales , they 'd turn into wolves and steal sheep and other animals when food was scarce . \\n and some of them changed just for the fun of it . '' \\n i studied his face , trying to read his voice . \\n `` is there fun in it ? '' \\n he looked away-ashamed of his answer , i thought , until i realized he was just looking over his shoulder to parallel park in front of a row of shops . \\n `` some of us seem to like it , maybe better than being human . \\n shelby loves it-but like i said , i think her human life was pretty awful . \\n i do n't know . \\n the wolf half of my life is such a part of me now , it 's hard to imagine living without it . '' \\n `` in a good way or a bad way ? '' \\n sam looked at me , yellow eyes catching and holding me . \\n `` i miss being me . \\n i miss you . \\n all the time . '' \\n i dropped my eyes to my hands . \\n `` not now you do n't . '' \\n sam reached across the bench seat and touched my hair , running a hand down it until he caught just the ends of it between his fingers . \\n he studied the hairs like they might contain the secrets of grace in their dull blonde strands . \\n his cheeks flushed slightly ; he still blushed when he complimented me . \\n `` no , '' he admitted , `` right in this moment , i ca n't even remember what unhappy feels like . '' \\n somehow that made tears prick at the corners of my eyes . \\n i blinked , glad he was still looking at my hair . \\n there was a long pause . \\n he said , `` you do n't remember being attacked . '' \\n `` what ? '' \\n `` you do n't remember being attacked at all , do you ? '' \\n i frowned and pulled my backpack onto my lap , startled by the seemingly random change of topic . \\n `` i do n't know . \\n maybe . \\n it seems like there were a lot of wolves , way more than i think there actually could 've been . \\n and i remember you-i remember you standing back , and then just touching my hand '' - sam touched my hand - `` and my cheek '' - he touched my cheek - `` when the others were rough with me . \\n i guess they wanted to eat me , right ? '' \\n his voice was soft . \\n `` you do n't remember what happened after that ? \\n how you survived ? '' \\n i tried to remember . \\n it was all a flash of snow , and red , and breath on my face . \\n then mom screaming . \\n but there must 've been something between all that . \\n i must 've gotten from the woods to the house somehow . \\n i tried to imagine walking , stumbling through the snow . \\n `` did i walk ? '' \\n he looked at me , waiting for me to answer my own question . \\n `` i know i did n't . \\n i ca n't remember . \\n why ca n't i remember ? '' \\n i was frustrated now , with my own brain 's inability to comply . \\n it seemed like such a simple request . \\n but i only remembered the scent of sam , sam everywhere , and then the unfamiliar sound of mom 's panic as she scrambled for the phone . \\n `` do n't worry about it , '' sam said . \\n `` it does n't matter . '' \\n but i thought it probably did . \\n i closed my eyes , recalling the scent of the woods that day and the jolting feeling of moving back toward the house , arms tight around me . \\n i opened my eyes again . \\n `` you carried me . '' \\n sam looked at me abruptly . \\n it was coming back , in the way you remember fever dreams . \\n `` but you were human , '' i said . \\n `` i remember seeing you as a wolf . \\n but you must 've been human to carry me . \\n how did you do that ? '' \\n he shrugged , helplessly . \\n `` i do n't know how i shifted . \\n it 's the same as when i was shot , and i was human when you found me . '' \\n i felt something fluttering in my chest , like hope . \\n `` you can make yourself change ? '' \\n `` it 's not like that . \\n it was only two times . \\n and i have n't been able to do it again , ever , no matter how badly i 've wanted to . \\n and believe me , i 've wanted it pretty badly . '' \\n sam turned off the bronco with an air of ending the conversation , and i reached into my backpack to pull out a hat . \\n as he locked the car , i stood on the sidewalk and waited . \\n sam came around the back of the car and stopped dead when he saw me . \\n `` oh my god , what is that ? '' \\n i used my thumb and middle finger to flick the multicolored pom-pom on top of my head . \\n `` in my language , we call it a hat . \\n it keeps my ears warm . '' \\n `` oh my god , '' sam said again , and closed the distance between us . \\n he cupped my face in his hands and studied me . \\n `` it 's horribly cute . '' \\n he kissed me , looked at the hat , and then he kissed me again . \\n i vowed never to lose the pom-pom hat . \\n sam was still holding my face ; i was sure everyone in town was looking now . \\n but i did n't want to pull away , and i let him kiss me one more time , this time soft as the snow , barely a touch , and then he released me and took my hand instead . \\n it took me a moment to find my voice , and when i did , i could n't stop grinning . \\n `` okay . \\n where are we going ? '' \\n it was cold enough that i knew it had to be close ; we could n't stay out here much longer . \\n sam 's fingers were laced tightly with mine . \\n `` to a grace-shop first . \\n that 's what a proper gentleman would do . '' \\n i giggled , completely unlike me , and sam laughed because he knew it . \\n i was drunk with sam . \\n i let him walk me down the stark concrete block to the crooked shelf , a little independent bookstore ; i had n't been there for a year . \\n it seemed stupid that i had n't , given how many books i read , but i was just a poor high schooler with a very limited allowance . \\n i got my books from the library . \\n `` this is a grace-shop , right ? '' \\n sam pushed open the door without waiting for my answer . \\n a wonderful wave of new-book smell came rushing out , reminding me immediately of christmas . \\n my parents always got me books for christmas . \\n with a melodic ding , the shop door swung shut behind us , and sam released my hand . \\n `` where to ? \\n i 'll buy you a book . \\n i know you want one . '' \\n i smiled at the stacks , inhaling again . \\n hundreds of thousands of pages that had never been turned , waiting for me . \\n the shelves were a warm , blond wood , piled with spines of every color . \\n staff picks were arranged on tables , glossy covers reflecting the light back at me . \\n behind the little cubby where the cashier sat , ignoring us , stairs covered with rich burgundy carpet led up to worlds unknown . \\n `` i could just live here , '' i said . \\n sam watched my face with obvious pleasure . \\n `` i remember watching you reading books on the tire swing . \\n even in the most stupid weather . \\n why did n't you read inside when it was so cold ? '' \\n my eyes followed the rows and rows of books . \\n `` books are more real when you read them outside . '' \\n i bit my lip , eyes flitting from shelf to shelf . \\n `` i do n't know where to go first . '' \\n `` i 'll show you something , '' sam said . \\n the way he said it made me believe that it was not only something but a very amazing something that he had waited all day to show me . \\n he took my hand again and led me through the store , past the uninterested cashier , and up the silent stairs that swallowed the sounds of our footsteps and kept them . \\n upstairs was a little loft , less than half the size of the store below , with a railing to keep us from tumbling back down to the ground floor . \\n `` one summer , i worked here . \\n sit . \\n wait . '' \\n sam guided me to a battered burgundy love seat that took up a large part of the floor space . \\n i took off my hat and sat , charmed by his orders , and checked out his butt while he searched on the shelves for whatever he was looking for . \\n unaware of my stare , he crouched , running his fingers along spines like they were old friends . \\n i watched the slope of his shoulders , the tilt of his head , the way one hand braced , fingers spread crablike on the floor , as he knelt by the shelves . \\n finally he found what he was looking for and he came over to the love seat . \\n `` close your eyes , '' he said . \\n without waiting for me , he pressed his hand over my eyelids , shutting them for me . \\n i felt the love seat shift as he slid in beside me , heard the inexplicably loud sound of the cover opening , the pages inside scraping against each other as he turned them . \\n then i felt his breath on my ear as he said , voice barely audible , '' ' i am alone in the world , and yet not alone enough to make each hour holy . \\n i am lowly in this world , and yet not lowly enough for me to be just a thing to you , dark and shrewd . \\n i want my will and i want to go with my will as it moves towards action . ' '' \\n he paused , long , the only sound his breath , a little ragged , before he went on , '' ` and i want , in those silent , somehow faltering times , to be with someone who knows , or else alone . \\n i want to reflect everything about you , and i never want to be too blind or too ancient to keep your profound wavering image with me . \\n i want to unfold . \\n i do n't want to be folded anywhere , because there , where i 'm folded , i am a lie . ' '' \\n i turned my face toward his voice , eyes still fast shut , and he put his mouth on mine . \\n i felt his lips pull from mine slightly , just for a moment , and heard the rustle of the book laid gently on the floor , and then he wrapped his arms around me . \\n his lips tasted cool and sharp , peppermint , winter , but his hands , soft on the back of my neck , promised long days and summer and forever . \\n i felt light-headed , like i was n't getting enough air , as if my breath was stolen as soon as i took it . \\n sam lay back on the couch , just a little , and pulled me into the circle his body made , and kissed me and kissed me , so careful , like my lips were a flower and if he touched them too roughly , they might bruise . \\n i do n't know how long we were curled against each other on the couch , silently kissing , before sam noticed that i was crying . \\n i felt him hesitate , salt water on his tongue , before he realized what the taste meant . \\n `` grace . \\n are you-crying ? '' \\n i did n't say anything , because that would only make the reason for my tears more real . \\n sam rubbed them away with his thumb , then pulled his sleeve over his fist to wipe the tracks away with the fabric . \\n `` grace , what 's wrong ? \\n did i do something wrong ? '' \\n sam 's yellow eyes were flickering over my face , looking for clues as i shook my head . \\n downstairs , i heard the cashier ringing up another customer . \\n it seemed very far away . \\n `` no , '' i said finally . \\n i rubbed another tear out of my eye before it could fall . \\n `` no , you did everything right . \\n it 's just that - '' i could n't say it . \\n i could n't . \\n sam did n't flinch . '' \\n - that this is my last year . '' \\n i bit my lip , hard , and rubbed away another tear . \\n `` i 'm not ready . \\n i 'll never be ready . '' \\n he did n't say anything . \\n maybe there was n't anything to say . \\n instead , he wrapped his arms around me again , only this time he guided my cheek onto his chest and ran his hand over the back of my head , clumsy but comforting . \\n i closed my eyes and listened to the thud of his heart until mine matched pace with his . \\n finally , he rested his cheek on the top of my head and whispered , `` we do n't have time to be sad . '' \\n the sun had become brilliant by the time we walked out of the bookstore , and with a shock i realized how much time had passed . \\n on cue , my stomach pinched with hunger . \\n `` lunch , '' i said . \\n `` immediately . \\n i 'm going to wither away to absolutely nothing . \\n then you 'll be racked with guilt . '' \\n `` i do n't doubt it . '' \\n sam took my little bag of new books and turned to put them in the bronco , but he froze partway toward the car , his eyes fixed somewhere behind me . \\n `` crap . \\n incoming . '' \\n he turned his back to me and unlocked the car , shoving the books onto the passenger seat , trying to look inconspicuous . \\n i turned around and found olivia , looking disheveled and tired . \\n then john appeared behind her and gave me a big grin . \\n i had n't seen him since before i met sam , and in comparison , i could n't fathom how i 'd ever imagined he was good-looking . \\n he looked dusty and ordinary in comparison beside sam 's black flop of hair and golden eyes . \\n `` hey , gorgeous , '' john said . \\n that turned sam around in a hurry . \\n he did n't move toward me , but he did n't have to-his yellow eyes stopped john in his tracks . \\n or maybe it was just sam 's stance beside me , shoulders stiff . \\n in the space of a second , i had a flashing thought that sam might be dangerous-that maybe he normally quieted the wolf inside him far more than he let on . \\n john had a weird , unreadable expression that made me wonder if all those months of pretend flirting had been more real than i 'd thought . \\n `` hi , '' olivia said . \\n she glanced at sam , whose gaze had been fixed on the camera slung over her shoulder . \\n he looked down and rubbed his eyes as though he 'd gotten something in one of them . \\n sam 's discomfort was catching , and my smile felt insincere . \\n `` hi . \\n funny bumping into you guys here . '' \\n `` we 're just running some errands for mom . '' \\n john 's eyes flicked toward sam and he smiled a little too pleasantly . \\n my cheeks warmed at the silent testosterone battle waging ; it was kind of flattering , if a little weird . \\n `` and olivia wanted to hit up the bookstore while we were out . \\n it 's friggin ' cold out here . \\n i 'm going to go on in . '' \\n `` they let illiterate people in there ? '' \\n i teased , like old times . \\n john grinned then , all tension gone , and grinned at sam , too , like , yeah , good luck with that , before heading into the store . \\n sam sort of smiled back , eyes squinted shut , still acting like he had something in them . \\n olivia remained on the sidewalk just outside the door , arms hugged around herself . \\n `` i never thought i 'd see you out of the house this early on a non-schoolday , '' she told me . \\n talking to me , but looking at sam . \\n `` i thought you hibernated on days off . '' \\n `` nope , not today , '' i said . \\n after this much time not talking to her , it felt like i did n't know how to do it anymore . \\n `` up early to see what it feels like . '' \\n `` amazing , '' olivia said . \\n she was still looking at sam , an unasked question hanging in the air . \\n i did n't want to introduce them , since sam seemed so uncomfortable around olivia and her camera , but i was hyperaware of the way she was looking at us : the space between the two of us , how it shifted as either of us moved , connected by invisible strings . \\n and the casual contact . \\n her eyes followed his hand to my arm as he touched my sleeve lightly , and then moved to his other hand , still rested on the handle of the car door-comfortable , like he 'd opened it many times before . \\n like he belonged with the bronco and with me . \\n finally , olivia said , `` who 's this ? '' \\n i glanced at sam , for approval . \\n his eyelids were still lowered , shadowing his eyes . \\n `` sam , '' he said softly . \\n there was something wrong with the tenor of his voice . \\n he was n't looking at the camera , but it seemed like i could feel his attention on it . \\n my voice inadvertently echoed his anxiety when i said , `` this is olivia . \\n olive , sam and i are going out . \\n i mean , dating . '' \\n i expected her to comment , but instead she said , `` i recognize you . '' \\n beside me , sam stiffened until she added , `` from the bookstore , right ? '' \\n sam flicked his eyes up to her , and she nodded , almost imperceptibly . \\n `` yes . \\n from the bookstore . '' \\n olivia , arms still crossed , fingered the edge of her sweater but did n't take her eyes from sam 's . \\n she seemed to be struggling to find words . \\n `` i-do you wear contacts ? \\n sorry to be so blunt . \\n you must get asked a lot . '' \\n `` i do , '' sam said . \\n `` get asked a lot . \\n and i do wear them . '' \\n something like disappointment flashed across olivia 's face . \\n `` well , they 're really cool . \\n um . \\n it was nice to meet you . '' \\n turning to me , she said , `` i 'm sorry . \\n it was a really stupid thing to fight over . '' \\n whatever i had been planning to say disappeared when she said i 'm sorry . \\n `` i 'm sorry , too , '' i replied , a little feebly , because i was n't really sure what i was apologizing for . \\n olivia looked at sam and then back at me . \\n `` yeah . \\n i just ... could you call me ? \\n later on ? '' \\n i blinked with surprise . \\n `` yeah , of course ! \\n when ? '' \\n `` i-actually , can i call you ? \\n i do n't know when will be a good time . \\n is that okay ? \\n can i just call your cell ? '' \\n `` anytime . \\n you sure you do n't want to go somewhere and talk now ? '' \\n `` um , no , not now . \\n i ca n't , because of john . '' \\n she shook her head and looked at sam again . \\n `` he wants to hang out . \\n later will be good , though , definitely . \\n thanks , grace . \\n i mean it . \\n i 'm so sorry about our stupid argument . '' \\n i pressed my lips together . \\n why was she thanking me ? \\n john stuck his head out of the bookstore 's door . \\n `` olive ? \\n are you coming , or what ? '' \\n olivia waved at us and disappeared into the bookstore with a little ding from the bookstore 's doorbell . \\n sam cupped his hands around the back of his head and heaved a huge , shaky sigh . \\n he paced a small circle on the sidewalk without lowering his hands . \\n i stepped past him and pulled open the passenger-side door . \\n `` are you going to tell me what 's going on ? \\n are you just camera shy , or is it something more ? '' \\n sam came around the other side of the bronco and got in , slamming the door shut , as if shutting olivia and all the weirdness of the conversation out . \\n `` i 'm sorry . \\n i just-i saw one of the wolves the other day and this jack thing just has me on edge . \\n and olivia-she took pictures of all of us . \\n as wolves . \\n and my eyes ... i was afraid that olivia knew more about me than she was saying and i just-freaked out . \\n i know . \\n i acted totally whacked , did n't i ? '' \\n `` yeah , you did . \\n you 're lucky that she was acting more whacked than you . \\n i hope she calls later . '' \\n unease crept through me . \\n sam touched my arm . \\n `` do you want to go someplace to eat or just head home ? '' \\n i groaned and put my forehead into my hand . \\n `` let 's just go home . \\n man . \\n i feel so weird , not finding out what she was talking about . '' \\n sam did n't say anything , but it was all right . \\n i was going over and over what olivia had said , trying to figure out why the conversation seemed so awkward . \\n trying to figure out what was n't being said . \\n i should 've said more to her after she told me that she was sorry . \\n but what else was there to say ? \\n we traveled along in silence back toward the house , until i realized how intensely selfish i was being . \\n `` i 'm sorry , i 'm ruining our date . '' \\n i reached over and took sam 's free hand ; he squeezed his fingers around mine . \\n `` first i bawled-which i never do , for the record-and now i 'm totally distracted by olivia . '' \\n `` shut up , '' sam said pleasantly . \\n `` we 've got plenty of day left . \\n and it 's nice to see you ... emote ... for once . \\n instead of being so damn stoic . '' \\n i smiled at the thought . \\n `` stoic ? \\n i like it . '' \\n `` figured you would . \\n but it was nice to not be the wishy-washy one for once . '' \\n i burst out laughing . \\n `` those are n't the words i 'd use to describe you . '' \\n `` you do n't think of me as a delicate flower in comparison to you ? '' \\n when i laughed again , he pressed , `` okay , what words would you use , then ? '' \\n i leaned back in the seat , thinking , as sam looked at me doubtfully . \\n he was right to look doubtful . \\n my head did n't work with words very well-at least not in this abstract , descriptive sort of way . \\n `` sensitive , '' i tried . \\n sam translated : `` squishy . '' \\n `` creative . '' \\n `` dangerously emo . '' \\n `` thoughtful . '' \\n `` feng shui . '' \\n i laughed so hard i snorted . \\n `` how do you get feng shui out of ` thoughtful ' ? '' \\n `` you know , because in feng shui , you arrange furniture and plants and stuff in thoughtful ways . '' \\n sam shrugged . \\n `` to make you calm . \\n zenlike . \\n or something . \\n i 'm not one hundred percent sure how it all works , besides the thoughtful part . '' \\n i playfully punched his arm and looked out the window as we got closer to home . \\n we were driving through a stand of oak trees on the way to my parents ' house . \\n dull orange-brown leaves , dry and dead , clung to the branches and fluttered in the wind , waiting for the gust of wind that would knock them to the ground . \\n that was what sam was : transient . \\n a summer leaf clinging to a frozen branch for as long as possible . \\n `` you 're beautiful and sad , '' i said finally , not looking at him when i did . \\n `` just like your eyes . \\n you 're like a song that i heard when i was a little kid but forgot i knew until i heard it again . '' \\n for a long moment there was only the whirring sound of the tires on the road , and then sam said softly , `` thank you . '' \\n we went home and slept on my bed all afternoon , our jeancovered legs tangled together and my face buried in his neck , the radio murmuring in the background . \\n around dinnertime , we wandered out to the kitchen to find food . \\n as sam carefully assembled sandwiches , i tried calling olivia . \\n john answered . \\n `` sorry , grace . \\n she 's out . \\n do you want me to tell her anything , or just to call you ? '' \\n `` just have her call me , '' i said , somehow feeling like i 'd let olivia down . \\n i hung up the phone and ran a finger along the counter absently . \\n i kept thinking about what she had said : stupid thing to argue about . \\n `` did you notice , '' i asked sam , `` when we came in , that it smelled out front ? \\n by the front step ? '' \\n sam handed me a sandwich . \\n `` yeah . '' \\n `` like pee , '' i said . \\n `` like wolf pee . '' \\n sam 's voice sounded unhappy . \\n `` yeah . '' \\n `` who do you think it was ? '' \\n `` i do n't think , '' sam said . \\n `` i know . \\n it 's shelby . \\n i can smell her . \\n she peed on the deck again , too . \\n i smelled it when i was out there yesterday . '' \\n i remembered her eyes , looking at mine through my bedroom window , and made a face . \\n `` why is she doing this ? '' \\n sam shook his head , and he sounded uncertain when he said , `` i just hope it 's about me and not about you . \\n i hope she 's just following me . '' \\n his eyes slid toward the front hallway ; distantly , i heard a car coming down the road . \\n `` i think that 's your mom . \\n i 'm going to vanish . '' \\n i frowned after him as he retreated into my room with his sandwich , the door closing softly behind him , leaving all the questions and doubts about shelby out here with me . \\n out front , the car 's tires rolled into the driveway . \\n i got my backpack and settled down so that by the time mom came in , i was sitting at the kitchen table staring at a problem set . \\n mom whirled in and tossed a pile of papers on the kitchen counter , dragging a rush of cold air in with her . \\n i winced , hoping sam was impervious behind my bedroom door . \\n her keys jangled as they slid onto the floor . \\n she picked them up , swearing lightly , and threw them back onto the papers . \\n `` have you eaten yet ? \\n i 'm feeling snacky . \\n we did paintball on the outing ! \\n i mean , his work paid for it . '' \\n i frowned at her . \\n half of my brain was still thinking about shelby , lurking around the house , watching sam , or watching me . \\n or watching us together . \\n `` what , for group bonding , i guess ? '' \\n mom did n't answer . \\n she opened the fridge and asked , `` do we have anything i can eat while i watch tv ? \\n god ! \\n what is this ? '' \\n `` it 's a pork loin , mom . \\n it 's for the slow cooker tomorrow . '' \\n she shuddered and closed the fridge . \\n `` it looks like a giant , chilled slug . \\n do you want to watch a movie with me ? '' \\n i looked past her toward the hall , looking for dad , but the hall was empty . \\n `` where 's dad ? '' \\n `` he went out for wings with the new guys from work . \\n you act like i 'd only ask you because he 's not here . '' \\n mom banged around the kitchen , pouring herself granola and leaving the box open on the counter before retreating toward the sofa . \\n once upon a time , i would 've leaped at the rare opportunity of curling up with mom on the couch . \\n but now , it sort of felt like too little , too late . \\n i had someone else waiting for me . \\n `` i 'm feeling a little off , '' i told mom . \\n `` i think i 'd rather just go to sleep early . '' \\n i had n't realized that i 'd wanted her face to fall until it did n't . \\n she just jumped onto the couch and grabbed the remote control . \\n as i turned to go , she said , `` by the way , do n't leave trash bags on the back deck , okay ? \\n animals are getting into it . '' \\n `` yeah , '' i said . \\n i had a feeling i knew which animal in particular . \\n i left her watching the movie on the couch , swept up my homework , and carried it all to my room . \\n opening my bedroom door , i found sam curled on my bed , reading a novel by the light of my bedside lamp , looking like he belonged there . \\n i knew he must 've heard me enter , but he did n't glance up from his book for a moment , finishing his chapter . \\n i loved looking at the shape his body made while he read , from the curved slope of his neck bent over the pages to the long forms of his sock feet . \\n finally , he stuck his finger in the book and closed it , smiling up at me , his eyebrows tipped together in their permanently mournful way . \\n he reached out an arm as an invitation , and i dumped my textbooks at the end of the bed and joined him . \\n he held his novel with one hand and stroked my hair with the other , and together we read the last three chapters . \\n it was a strange book where everyone had been taken from earth except for the main character and his lover , and they had to choose whether to make their ultimate mission finding the ones who had been taken or having earth all to themselves and repopulating at their leisure . \\n when we were done , sam rolled onto his back and stared at the ceiling . \\n i drew slow circles on his flat stomach with my fingers . \\n `` which would you choose ? '' \\n he asked . \\n in the book , the characters had searched for the others , only to get separated and end up alone . \\n for some reason , sam 's question made my heart beat a little faster , and i gripped a handful of his t-shirt in my fist . \\n `` duh , '' i said . \\n sam 's lips curled up . \\n it was n't until later that i realized that olivia had n't returned my call . \\n when i called her house , her mother told me she was still out . \\n a little voice inside me said out where ? \\n where is there to be out in mercyfalls ? \\n that night when i fell asleep , i dreamed of shelby 's face in my window and jack 's eyes in the woods . \\n chapter thirty-three sam 41of that night , for the first time in a long time , i dreamed of mr. dario 's dogs . \\n i woke , sweaty and shuddering , the taste of blood in my mouth . \\n i rolled away from grace , feeling like my pounding heart would wake her , and licked my bloody lips . \\n i 'd bitten my tongue . \\n it was so easy to forget the primitive violence of my world when i was human , safe in grace 's bed . \\n it was easy to see us as she must see us : ghosts in the woods , silent , magical . \\n and if we were only wolves , maybe she would be right . \\n real wolves would n't be a threat . \\n but these were n't real wolves . \\n the dream whispered that i was ignoring the signs . \\n the ones that said i was bringing the violence of my world to grace 's . \\n wolves at her school , her friend 's house , and now hers . \\n wolves that hid human hearts within their pelts . \\n lying there in grace 's bed in the dark room , i strained my ears , listening . \\n i thought i could hear toenails on the deck , and imagined i could smell shelby 's scent even through the window . \\n i knew she wanted me-wanted what i stood for . \\n i was the favorite of beck , the human pack leader , and also of paul , the wolf pack leader , and the logical successor to both . \\n in our little world , i had a lot of power . \\n and , oh , shelby wanted power . \\n dario 's dogs proved that . \\n when i was thirteen and living in beck 's house , our nearest neighbor -lrb- some seventy-five acres away -rrb- moved out and sold his gigantic house to a wealthy eccentric by the name of mr. dario . \\n personally , i did n't find mr. dario himself very impressive . \\n he had a peculiar smell that suggested he 'd died and then been preserved . \\n he spent most of the time we were in his house explaining the complicated alarm device he 'd installed to protect his antiques business -lrb- `` he means drugs , '' beck told me later -rrb- and waxing poetic about the guard dogs he turned out of his house while he was gone . \\n then he showed them to us . \\n they were gargoyles come to life , snarling masks of froth and wrinkled , pale skin . \\n a south american breed meant to guard cattle , mr. dario said . \\n he looked pleased when he explained that they would rip a man 's face off and eat it . \\n beck 's expression was dubious as he said he hoped mr. dario did n't let them off the property . \\n pointing to collars with metallic prongs on the inside -lrb- `` shocks the hell out of the dogs , '' beck said later , and made a jiggling motion to indicate voltage -rrb- , mr. dario assured us that the only people getting their faces ripped off would be the ones sneaking onto the property at night to steal his antiques . \\n he showed us the power box that controlled the dogs ' shock collars and kept them near the house ; it was covered with a powdery black paint that left dark smudges on his hands . \\n nobody else seemed to think about those dogs , but i was obsessed with them . \\n all i could think about was them getting loose and tearing beck or paul to pieces , ripping one of their faces off and eating it . \\n for weeks , i was preoccupied with the idea of the dogs , and in the heat of summer , i found beck in the kitchen , in shorts and a t-shirt , basting ribs for the barbecue . \\n `` beck ? '' \\n he did n't look up from his careful painting . \\n `` what do you need , sam ? '' \\n `` would you show me how to kill mr. dario 's dogs ? '' \\n beck spun to face me , and i added , `` if i had to ? '' \\n `` you wo n't have to . '' \\n i hated to beg , but i did it , anyway . \\n `` please ? '' \\n beck winced . \\n `` you do n't have the stomach for that sort of work . '' \\n it was true-as a human , i had an agonizing sensitivity to the sight of blood . \\n `` please ? '' \\n beck made a face and told me no , but the next day , he brought home half a dozen raw chickens and taught me how to find the weak part of the joints and break them . \\n when i did n't pass out at the sight of snapping chickens , he brought red meat that oozed blood and made my jaw slack with nausea . \\n the bones were hard , cold , unforgiving under my hands , impossible to break without finding the joint . \\n `` tired of this yet ? '' \\n beck asked after a few days . \\n i shook my head ; the dogs haunted my dreams and ran through the songs that i wrote . \\n so we kept on . \\n beck found home videos of dogfights ; together we watched the dogs tear each other apart . \\n i kept a hand pressed over my mouth , my stomach churning at the sight of gore , and watched how some dogs went for the jugular and some went for the front legs , snapping them and rendering their opponents powerless . \\n beck pointed out one particularly unequal fight , a huge pit bull and a little mixed terrier . \\n `` look at the little dog . \\n that would be you . \\n when you 're human , you 're stronger than most people , but you 're still not going to be as strong as one of dario 's dogs . \\n look how the little one fights . \\n he weakens the big dog . \\n then suffocates him . '' \\n i watched the little terrier kill the bigger dog . \\n and then beck and i went outside and fought-big dog , little dog . \\n summer vanished . \\n we began to change , one by one , the oldest and most careless of us first . \\n soon there was just a handful of humans left : beck , out of stubbornness , ulrik , from sheer cunning , shelby , to be closer to beck and me . \\n me , because i was young and not yet fragile . \\n i will never forget the sounds of a dogfight . \\n someone who has n't heard it ca n't imagine the sort of primal savagery of two dogs bent on destroying each other . \\n even as a wolf , i never came across that sort of struggle-pack members fought for dominance , not to kill . \\n i was in the woods ; beck had told me not to leave the house , so of course i was out walking in the evening . \\n i had half an idea that i was going to write a song in the exact moment between day and night , and i had just seized a scrap of a lyric when i heard the dogfight . \\n the sound was close , here in the woods , not near mr. dario 's , but i knew it could n't be wolves . \\n i recognized that rippling snarl immediately . \\n and then they came into sight . \\n two giant white ghosts of dogs in the dim evening : dario 's monsters . \\n with them , a black wolf , struggling , bleeding , rolling in the underbrush . \\n the wolf , paul , was doing everything pack behavior dictated-ears back , tail down , half-turned head-everything he did screamed submission . \\n but the dogs knew no pack behavior ; all they knew was attack . \\n and so they began to pull paul to shreds . \\n `` hey ! '' \\n i shouted , my voice not as strong as i 'd expected . \\n i tried again , and this time it was halfway to a growl , `` hey ! '' \\n one of the dogs broke off and rushed me ; i spun and rolled , my eyes on the other white demon , its teeth clasped on the black wolf 's throat . \\n paul was gasping for breath , and the side of his face was soaked with crimson . \\n i threw myself against the dog that held him , and the three of us crashed to the ground . \\n the monster was heavy , blood-streaked , and all muscle . \\n i grabbed for its throat with a pitifully weak human hand and missed . \\n dead weight hit my back and i felt hot drool on my neck . \\n i twisted just in time to avoid a killing bite from one dog and got the other 's teeth in my shoulder instead . \\n i felt bone grate against bone-the sick , fiery sensation of the dog 's tooth sliding up against my collarbone . \\n `` beck ! '' \\n i yelled . \\n it was maddeningly hard to think through the pain and with paul dying in front of me . \\n still , i remembered that little terrier-fast , deadly , brutal . \\n i snaked a hand forward to the dog that had the murder grip on paul 's neck . \\n i grabbed the front leg , found the joint , and i did n't think about the blood . \\n i did n't think about the sound it was going to make . \\n i did n't think about anything but the mechanical action of snap . \\n the dog 's eyes rolled . \\n it whistled through its nose but did n't release its grip . \\n my survival instinct was screaming at me to get the other animal off me ; it was shaking and grinding my shoulder in jaws that felt iron-heavy and fire-hot . \\n i imagined i could feel my bones wrenching free from their proper positions . \\n i imagined my arm was being torn from its socket . \\n but paul could n't wait . \\n i could n't feel my right arm very well , but with my left i grabbed a handful of dog throat in my hand and twisted , tightened , suffocated , until i heard the monster gasping . \\n i was that little terrier . \\n the dog was tireless in its grip on paul 's neck , but i was equally tireless in mine . \\n reaching up from under the other dog that was grinding my shoulder down , i flopped my dead right hand over the first dog 's nose and pressed its nostrils closed . \\n i did n't think of anything-my mind was far away , in the house , someplace warm , listening to music , reading a poem , anywhere but here , killing . \\n for a terrible minute nothing happened . \\n sparks flashed before my eyes . \\n then the dog flopped to the ground , and paul fell out of its grip . \\n there was blood everywhere-mine , paul 's , the dog 's . \\n `` do n't let go ! '' \\n it was beck 's voice , and now i heard the dull crash of footsteps in the woods . \\n `` do n't let go-he 's not dead yet ! '' \\n i could n't feel my hands anymore-couldn ' t feel anything anymore-but i thought i was still clutching the dog 's neck , the one that had been biting paul . \\n and then i felt the teeth in my shoulder jerk as the dog gripping my neck lurched . \\n a wolf , ulrik , was snarling , going for its neck , dragging it off me . \\n there was a pop , and i realized it was a gun . \\n another pop again , much closer , and a jerk beneath my fingers . \\n ulrik backed away from us , breathing hard , and then there was so much silence that my ears rang . \\n beck gently peeled my hands off the dead dog 's throat and pressed them against my shoulder instead . \\n the blood flow slowed ; immediately i started to feel better as my incredible , messed-up body started to heal itself . \\n beck knelt in front of me . \\n he was shaking with the cold , his skin gray , the bend of his shoulders wrong . \\n `` you had it right , did n't you ? \\n you saved him . \\n those poor damn chickens did n't go to waste . '' \\n behind him , shelby stood silently , arms crossed , watching paul gasping in the dry , dead leaves . \\n watching me and beck with our heads together . \\n her hands were fists , and one of them had a black , powdery smear on it . \\n now , in the soft darkness of grace 's room , i rolled over and pressed my face into her shoulder . \\n strange that my most violent moments had been as a human , not as a wolf . \\n outside , i heard the distinct scratching of toenails on the deck . \\n i closed my eyes and tried to concentrate on the sound of grace 's beating heart . \\n the taste of blood in my mouth reminded me of winter . \\n i knew shelby had let those dogs out . \\n she wanted me at the top , with her beside me , and paul was in my way . \\n and now grace was in hers . \\n chapter thirty-four grace 49of days blurred into a collage of common images : cool walks across the school parking lot , olivia 's empty seat in class , sam 's breath in my ear , pawprints in our yard 's frosted blades of grass . \\n by the time the weekend arrived , i felt breathless with waiting , although i was n't sure what i was waiting for . \\n sam had tossed and turned the night before , plagued by a nightmare , and he looked so terrible on saturday morning that instead of making any plans to go out , i just parked him on the couch after my parents had gone to brunch at a friend 's house . \\n i lay in the curve of sam 's arm as he flipped between various bad made-for-tv movies . \\n we settled on a sci-fi thriller that had probably cost less to produce than the bronco . \\n rubbery tentacles were everywhere when sam finally said something . \\n `` does it bother you ? \\n that your parents are the way they are ? '' \\n i nuzzled my face into his armpit . \\n it smelled very sam in there . \\n `` let 's not talk about them . '' \\n `` let 's do talk about them . '' \\n `` oh , why ? \\n what 's there to tell ? \\n it 's fine . \\n they 're fine . \\n they 're the way they are . '' \\n sam 's fingers gently found my chin and lifted my face up . \\n `` grace , it 's not fine . \\n i 've been here for-how many weeks now ? \\n i do n't even know . \\n but i know how it is , and it 's not fine . '' \\n `` they are who they are . \\n i never knew anybody 's parents were any different until i started school . \\n until i started reading . \\n but seriously , sam , it 's okay . '' \\n my skin felt hot . \\n i pulled my chin away from his hand and looked at the screen , where a compact car was drowning in slime . \\n `` grace , '' sam said softly . \\n he was sitting so still , as if , for once , i was the wild animal that might vanish if he moved a muscle . \\n `` you do n't have to pretend around me . '' \\n i watched the car crumble into pieces , along with the driver and the passenger . \\n it was hard to tell what was going on with the sound turned down , but it looked like the pieces were reforming into tentacles . \\n there was a guy walking a dog in the background , and he did n't even seem to notice . \\n how could he not notice ? \\n i did n't look at sam , but i knew he was watching me , not the television . \\n i did n't know what he thought i was going to say . \\n i had nothing to say . \\n this was not a problem . \\n it was a way of life . \\n the tentacles on the screen began to drag along the ground , looking for the original tentacled monster so that they could reattach themselves . \\n there was no way they would be able to ; the original alien was on fire in washington , dc , melting around a model of the washingtonmonument . \\n the new tentacles were just going to have to torment the world on their own . \\n `` why ca n't i make them love me any more than they do ? '' \\n did i say that ? \\n it did n't sound like my voice . \\n sam 's fingers brushed my cheek , but there were n't any tears . \\n i was nowhere close to tears . \\n `` grace , they love you . \\n it 's not about you . \\n it 's their problem . '' \\n `` i 've tried so hard . \\n i never get into trouble . \\n i always do my homework . \\n i cook their damn meals , when they 're home , which is never - '' definitely not my voice . \\n i did n't swear . \\n `` and i nearly got killed , twice , but that did n't change anything . \\n it 's not like i want them to jump all over me . \\n i just want , one day , just want - '' i could n't finish the sentence , because i did n't know how it ended . \\n sam dragged me into his arms . \\n `` oh , grace , i 'm sorry . \\n i did n't mean to make you cry . '' \\n `` i 'm not crying . '' \\n he wiped my cheeks with his thumb , carefully , and showed me the tear trapped on his fingertip . \\n feeling foolish , i let him ball me up in his lap and tuck me under his chin . \\n i had my own voice back again , here in the muffled shelter of his arms . \\n `` maybe i 'm too good . \\n if i got into trouble at school or burned down people 's garages , they 'd have to notice me . '' \\n `` you 're not like that . \\n you know you 're not , '' he said . \\n `` they 're just silly , selfish people , that 's all . \\n i 'm sorry i asked , okay ? \\n let 's just watch this dumb movie . '' \\n i laid my cheek against his chest and listened to the thump - thump of his heart . \\n it sounded so normal , just a regular human heart . \\n he 'd been human long enough now that i almost could n't detect the faint odor of the woods on him or remember what it felt like to bury my fingers in his ruff . \\n sam turned up the volume on the aliens and we sat like that , one creature in two bodies , for a long time , until i forgot what i 'd been upset about and i was myself again . \\n `` i wish i had what you have , '' i said . \\n `` what do i have ? '' \\n `` your pack . \\n beck . \\n ulrik . \\n when you talk about them , i can see how important they are to you , '' i said . \\n `` they made you this person . '' \\n i pushed a finger into his chest . \\n `` they 're wonderful , so you 're wonderful . '' \\n sam closed his eyes . \\n `` i do n't know about that . '' \\n he opened them again . \\n `` anyway , your parents made you who you are , too . \\n do you think you 'd be so independent if they were around more ? \\n at least you 're someone when they 're not around . \\n i feel like i 'm not who i was before . \\n because so much of being me is being with beck and ulrik and the others . '' \\n i heard a car pull into the driveway and straightened up . \\n i knew sam had heard it , too . \\n `` time to vanish , '' he said . \\n but i held on to his arm . \\n `` i 'm tired of sneaking around . \\n i think it 's time for you to meet them . '' \\n he did n't argue , but he threw a worried glance in the direction of the front door . \\n `` and now we come to the end , '' he said . \\n `` do n't be melodramatic . \\n they wo n't kill you . '' \\n he looked at me . \\n heat flushed my cheeks . \\n `` sam , i did n't mean it like-god . \\n i 'm sorry . '' \\n i wanted to look away from his face , but i could n't seem to , like watching a car crash . \\n i kept waiting for the collision , but his expression never changed . \\n it was as if there was a little disconnect between the memories of sam 's parents and his emotions , a slight misfire that mercifully kept him whole . \\n sam rescued me by changing the subject , which was incredibly generous . \\n `` should i play the friendly boyfriend or are we just friends ? '' \\n `` boyfriend . \\n i 'm not pretending . '' \\n sam edged two inches away from me and pulled his arm from behind my head , resting it on the back of the couch behind me instead . \\n to the wall , he said , `` hello , grace 's parents . \\n i 'm grace 's boyfriend . \\n please notice the chaste distance between us . \\n i am very responsible and have never had my tongue in your daughter 's mouth . '' \\n the door cracked open and both of us jumped with matching nervous laughs . \\n `` is that you , grace ? '' \\n mom 's voice called lightly from the hallway . \\n `` or are you a burglar ? '' \\n `` burglar , '' i called back . \\n `` i 'm going to wet myself , '' sam whispered in my ear . \\n `` are you sure that 's you , grace ? '' \\n mom sounded suspicious ; she was n't used to me laughing . \\n `` is rachel here ? '' \\n dad came first into the living room doorway and stopped , immediately spotting sam . \\n in a barely perceptible movement , sam turned his head just enough that the light did n't catch his yellow eyes , an automatic gesture that made me realize for the first time that sam had been an oddity even before he 'd been a wolf . \\n dad 's eyes were on sam , just looking . \\n sam was looking back , tense but not terrified . \\n would he be sitting so calmly if he knew that dad had been one of the hunting party in the woods ? \\n i was suddenly ashamed of my father , just another human that the wolves had to fear ; i was glad i had n't said anything to sam . \\n my voice was tight . \\n `` dad , this is sam . \\n sam , this is dad . '' \\n dad looked at him for a split second more , and then smiled widely . \\n `` please tell me you 're a boyfriend . '' \\n sam 's eyes became perfectly round and i let out a big breath . \\n `` yes , he 's a boyfriend , dad . '' \\n `` well , that 's nice . \\n i was beginning to think you did n't do that kind of thing . '' \\n `` dad . '' \\n `` what 's going on in there ? '' \\n mom 's voice was distant . \\n she was already in the kitchen , rummaging in the fridge . \\n the food at the brunch must 've been bad . \\n `` who 's sam ? '' \\n `` my boyfriend . '' \\n with mom 's presence came an ever-present cloud of turpentine vapors ; she had paint smeared on her lower arms . \\n knowing mom , i guessed she 'd intentionally left herself that way when she went out . \\n she looked from me to sam and back to me again , her expression quizzical . \\n `` mom , this is sam . \\n sam , mom . '' \\n i smelled emotions rolling off both of them , though i could n't tell which ones , exactly . \\n mom was staring at sam 's eyes , just staring and staring , and sam seemed fixed in place . \\n i punched his arm . \\n `` nice to meet you , '' he said , voice automatic . \\n `` mom , '' i hissed . \\n `` mom . \\n earth to mom . '' \\n to her credit , she looked slightly abashed when she snapped out of it . \\n she said to sam , apologetic , `` your face looks very familiar . '' \\n yeah . \\n right . \\n as if even an infant could n't tell it was a transparent excuse for staring at his eyes . \\n `` i used to work at the bookstore downtown ? '' \\n sam 's voice was hopeful . \\n mom wagged a finger at him . \\n `` i 'll bet that 's it . '' \\n she beamed at sam then , used her hundred-watt smile , erasing any social atrocity she may have just committed . \\n `` well , it 's nice to meet you . \\n i 'm going to go upstairs and work for a while . '' \\n she displayed her painted arms , indicating what she meant by `` work , '' and i felt a brief flash of irritation toward her . \\n i knew her serial flirtation was just habitual , a knee-jerk reaction to any unfamiliar guy who had reached puberty , but still . \\n grow up . \\n sam surprised me by saying , `` i 'd like to see the studio , while i 'm here , if you do n't mind . \\n grace told me a little bit about your art and i 'd love to see it . '' \\n this was partially true . \\n i 'd told him about a particularly nauseating show of hers i 'd gone to where all of the paintings were named after types of clouds but were portraits of women in bathing suits . \\n `` meaningful '' art sailed over my head . \\n i did n't get it . \\n i did n't want to get it . \\n mom smiled in a plastic sort of way . \\n she probably thought sam 's understanding of meaningful art was similar to mine . \\n i looked at sam dubiously . \\n this sort of sucking up seemed unlike him . \\n after mom had vanished upstairs and dad had vanished into his study , i demanded , `` are you a sucker for punishment ? '' \\n sam unmuted the television in time for a woman to be eaten by something with tentacles . \\n all that was left after the attack was a fake-looking severed arm lying on the sidewalk . \\n `` i just think i need to make her like me . '' \\n `` the only person in this house who has to like you is me . \\n do n't worry about them . '' \\n sam picked up a sofa cushion and hugged it to himself , pressing his face into it . \\n his voice was muffled . \\n `` she might have to put up with me for a long time , you know ? '' \\n `` how long ? '' \\n his smile was amazingly sweet . \\n `` the longest . '' \\n `` forever ? '' \\n sam 's lips smiled , but above his grin , his yellow eyes turned sad , as if he knew it was a lie . \\n `` longer . '' \\n i closed the distance between us and settled into the crook of his arm , and we went back to watching the tentacled alien slowly creep through the sewer system of an unsuspecting town . \\n sam 's eyes flickered around the screen , as if he was actually watching the futile intergalactic battle , but i sat there and tried to figure out why sam had to change and i did n't . \\n chapter thirty-five sam 49of after the sci-fi flick ended -lrb- the world was saved , but civilian casualties were high -rrb- , i sat with grace at the little breakfast table near the door to the deck and watched her do her homework for a while . \\n i was unimaginably tired-the colder weather gnawed at me like an ache , even when it could n't get a tight enough grip to change me-and i would 've liked to crawl into grace 's bed or onto the couch for a nap . \\n but the wolf side of me felt restless and unable to sleep with unfamiliar people around . \\n so to keep myself awake , i left grace downstairs doing her homework in the dying light from the windows and went upstairs to see the studio . \\n it was easy to find ; there were only two doors in the hallway upstairs and an orange , chemical smell wafted out from one of them . \\n the door was slightly ajar . \\n i pushed it open and blinked . \\n the entire room was brilliantly lit by lamps fitted with bulbs meant to mimic natural light , and the effect was a cross between a desert at noon and a wal-mart . \\n the walls were hidden behind towering canvases that leaned against every available surface . \\n gorgeous riots of color , realistic figures in unrealistic poses , normal shapes in abnormal colors , the unexpected in ordinary places . \\n the paintings were like falling into a dream , where everything you know is presented in an unfamiliar way . \\n anything 's possible in this lush rabbit hole / is it mirror or portrait you 've given to me ? \\n / all of these permutations of dreams will patrol / this lovely wasteland of color i see . \\n i stood before two larger-than-life paintings leaning against one of the walls . \\n both were of a man kissing a woman 's neck , poses identical but colors radically different . \\n one was shot through with reds and purples . \\n it was bright , ugly , commercial . \\n the other was dark , blue , lavender , hard to read . \\n understated and lovely . \\n it reminded me of kissing grace in the bookstore , how she felt in my arms , warm and real . \\n `` which one do you like ? '' \\n her mom 's voice sounded bright and approachable . \\n i imagined it as her gallery voice . \\n the one she used to lure viewers ' wallets into sight so that she could shoot them . \\n i tilted my head toward the blue one . \\n `` no contest . '' \\n `` really ? '' \\n she sounded genuinely surprised . \\n `` no one has ever said that before . \\n that one 's much more popular . '' \\n she stepped into my view so that i could see that she was pointing at the red one . \\n `` i 've sold hundreds of prints of it . '' \\n `` it 's very pretty , '' i said kindly , and she laughed . \\n `` it 's hideous . \\n do you know what they 're called ? '' \\n she pointed to the blue one , then the red one . \\n `` love and lust . '' \\n i smiled at her . \\n `` guess i failed my testosterone test , did n't i ? '' \\n `` because you chose love ? \\n i do n't think so , but that 's just me . \\n grace told me it was stupid of me to paint the same thing twice . \\n she said his eyes are too close together in both of them , anyway . '' \\n i grinned . \\n `` sounds like something she would say . \\n but she 's not an artist . '' \\n her mouth twisted into a rueful shape . \\n `` no . \\n she 's very practical . \\n i do n't know where she got that from . '' \\n i walked slowly to the next set of paintings-wildlife walking through clothing racks , deer perched on high-rise windows , fish peering up through storm drains . \\n `` that disappoints you . '' \\n `` oh , no . \\n no . \\n grace is just grace , and you just have to take her the way she is . '' \\n she hung back , letting me look , years of good sales training in subconscious practice . \\n `` and i suppose she 'll have an easier time in life because she 'll get a nice normal job and be good and stable . '' \\n i did n't look at her when i answered . \\n `` methinks the mom doth protest too much . '' \\n i heard her sigh . \\n `` i guess everyone wants their kid to turn out like them . \\n all grace cares about is numbers and books and the way things work . \\n it 's hard for me to understand her . '' \\n `` and vice versa . '' \\n `` yes . \\n but you 're an artist , are n't you ? \\n you must be . '' \\n i shrugged . \\n i had noticed a guitar case sitting close to the door of her studio , and i was itching to find chords for some of the tunes in my head . \\n `` not with paint . \\n i play a little guitar . '' \\n there was a long pause as she watched me looking at a painting of a fox peering out from beneath a parked car , and then she said , `` do you wear contacts ? '' \\n i 'd been asked the question so many times that i did n't even wonder anymore at how much nerve it had taken to ask it . \\n `` nope . '' \\n `` i 'm having a terrible painter 's block right now . \\n i would love to do a quick study of you . '' \\n she laughed . \\n it was a very self-conscious sound . \\n `` that 's why i was ogling you downstairs . \\n i just thought it would make an amazing color study , your black hair and your eyes . \\n you remind me of the wolves in our woods . \\n did grace tell you about them ? '' \\n my body stiffened . \\n it felt too close , like she was prying , especially after the run-in with olivia . \\n my immediate wolfish instinct was to bolt . \\n tear down the stairs , rip open the door , and melt into the safety of the trees . \\n it took me several long moments to battle the desire to run and convince myself that she could n't possibly know , and that i was reading too much into her words . \\n another long moment to realize that i had been standing for too long not saying anything . \\n `` oh-i do n't mean to make it awkward for you . '' \\n her words tumbled over each other . \\n `` you do n't have to sit for me . \\n i know some people feel really self-conscious . \\n and you probably want to be getting back downstairs to grace . '' \\n i felt obliged to make up for my rudeness . \\n `` no-no , that 's okay . \\n i mean , i do feel sort of self-conscious about it . \\n can i do something while you paint me ? \\n i mean , so i do n't have to just sit and stare off into space ? '' \\n she literally ran over to her easel . \\n `` no ! \\n of course not . \\n why do n't you play the guitar ? \\n oh , this is going to be great . \\n thank you . \\n you can just sit over there , under those lights . '' \\n while i retrieved the guitar case , she ran across her studio several more times , getting a chair for me , adjusting the spotlights , and draping a yellow sheet to reflect golden light on one side of my face . \\n `` do i have to try to stay still ? '' \\n she waved a paintbrush at me , as if that would answer my question , then propped a new canvas against her easel and squeezed gobs of black paint onto a palette . \\n `` no , no , just play away . '' \\n so i tuned the guitar , and i sat there in the golden light and played and hummed the songs under my breath , thinking of all the times i 'd sat on beck 's couch and played songs for the pack , of paul playing his guitar with me and us singing harmonies . \\n in the background , i heard the scrape , scrape of the palette knife and the whuff of the brush on the canvas and wondered what she was doing with my face while i was n't paying attention . \\n `` i can hear you humming , '' she said . \\n `` do you sing ? '' \\n i grunted , still fingerpicking idly . \\n her brush never ceased moving . \\n `` are those your songs ? '' \\n `` yup . '' \\n `` have you written one for grace ? '' \\n i had written a thousand songs for grace . \\n `` yes . '' \\n `` i 'd like to hear it . '' \\n i did n't stop playing , just modulated carefully into a major key . \\n for the first time this year , i sang out loud . \\n it was the happiest tune i 'd ever written , and the simplest . \\n i fell for her in summer , my lovely summer girl from summer she is made , my lovely summer girl i 'd love to spend a winter with my lovely summer girl but i 'm never warm enough for my lovely summer girl it 's summer when she smiles , i 'm laughing like a child it 's the summer of our lives ; we 'll contain it for a while she holds the heat , the breeze of summer in the circle of her hand i 'd be happy with this summer if it 's all we ever had . \\n she looked at me . \\n `` i do n't know what to say . '' \\n she showed me her arm . \\n `` i have goose bumps . '' \\n i set the guitar down , very carefully , so the strings would n't make any sound . \\n suddenly it seemed very pressing to spend my moments , so precious and numbered , with grace . \\n and in the moment i made that decision , there was a terrific crash from downstairs . \\n it was so loud and so wrong that for a moment her mother and i just frowned at each other as if we could n't believe that the sound had happened . \\n then there was the scream . \\n right after , i heard a snarl , and was out of the room before i could hear any more . \\n chapter thirty-six sam 49of i remembered shelby 's face when she asked , `` would you like to see my scars ? '' \\n `` from what ? '' \\n i replied . \\n `` from when i was attacked . \\n from the wolves . '' \\n `` no . '' \\n she showed me anyway . \\n her belly was lumpy with scar tissue that disappeared under her bra . \\n `` it looked like hamburger after they bit me . '' \\n i did n't want to know . \\n shelby did n't pull her shirt back down . \\n `` it must be hell when we kill something . \\n we must be the worst way to die . '' \\n chapter thirty-seven sam 42of a riot of sensations assaulted me as soon as i got into the living room . \\n viciously cold air stung my eyes and twisted my stomach . \\n my eyes quickly found the ragged hole in the door to the back deck ; partially cracked glass hung precariously in the frame and thin , pink-stained shards lay all over the floor , winking light back up at me . \\n the chair at the breakfast nook was knocked over . \\n it looked like someone had splattered red paint on the floor , endless erratic shapes dropped and smeared from the door to the kitchen . \\n then i smelled shelby . \\n for a moment i stood there , frozen by the absence of grace and the frigid air and the stench of blood and wet fur . \\n `` sam ! '' \\n it had to be grace , though her voice sounded strange and unrecognizable-someone pretending to be grace . \\n i scrambled , slipping in the spots of blood , gripping the doorjamb to pull myself into the kitchen . \\n the scene was surreal in the pleasant light of the kitchen . \\n bloody pawprints pointed the direction to where shelby shook and twisted , grace pinned to the cupboards . \\n grace was struggling , kicking , but shelby was massive and reeked of adrenaline . \\n i saw a flash of pain in grace 's eyes , honest and wide , before shelby jerked her body away . \\n i 'd seen this image before . \\n i did n't feel the cold anymore . \\n i saw an iron skillet sitting on the stove and grabbed it ; my arm ached with the weight of it . \\n i did n't want to hit grace-i smashed it on shelby 's hip . \\n shelby snarled back at me , teeth snapping together . \\n we did n't have to speak the same language to know what she was telling me . \\n stay back . \\n an image filled my field of vision , clear , perfect , riveting : grace lying on the kitchen floor , flopping , dying , while shelby watched . \\n i was paralyzed by this clarion picture dropped into my thoughts-this is how it must 've felt when i showed grace the image of the golden wood . \\n it felt like a razor-sharp memory , a memory of grace gasping for breath . \\n i dropped the skillet and threw myself at shelby . \\n i found her muzzle where she was clamped onto grace 's arm , and i felt back to her jaw . \\n pressing my fingers into the tender skin , i jammed upward , into her windpipe , until shelby yelped . \\n her grip loosened enough for me to push off the cabinets with my feet and roll her off grace . \\n we scrabbled across the floor , her nails clicking and scraping on the tile and my shoes squeaking and slipping in the blood she dripped . \\n she snarled beneath me , furious , snapping at my face but stopping short of biting me . \\n the image of grace lifeless on the floor just kept going through my head . \\n i remembered snapping chicken bones . \\n in my mind , i could see perfectly what it would look like to kill shelby . \\n she jerked away from me , out of my hands , as if she 'd read my thoughts . \\n `` dad , no , watch out ! '' \\n grace shouted . \\n a gun exploded , close by . \\n for a brief moment , time stood still . \\n not really still . \\n it sort of danced and shimmered in place , the lights flickering and dimming before reappearing . \\n if that moment had been a real thing , it would 've been a butterfly , flapping and fluttering toward the sun . \\n shelby fell out of my grip , deadweight , and i fell back into the cabinets behind me . \\n she was dead . \\n or at least close , because she was jerking . \\n but all i could seem to think about was how i 'd made a mess of the kitchen floor . \\n i just stared at the white squares of linoleum , my eyes following the streaky lines my shoes had made through the blood and finding the one red pawprint in the center of the kitchen that had somehow been perfectly preserved . \\n i could n't figure how i could smell the blood so strongly , and then i looked down at my shaking arms and saw the red smeared on my hands and over my wrists . \\n i had to struggle to remember that it was shelby 's blood . \\n she was dead . \\n this was her blood . \\n not mine . \\n hers . \\n my parents counted backward , slowly , and blood welled up from my veins . \\n i was going to throw up . \\n i was ice . \\n i `` we have to move him ! '' \\n the girl 's voice was piercingly loud in the silence . \\n `` get him someplace warm . \\n i 'm all right . \\n i 'm all right . \\n i just-help me move him ! '' \\n their voices tore into my head , too loud and too many . \\n i sensed movement all around me , their bodies and my skin whirling and spinning , but deep inside me , there was a part that held completely still . \\n grace . \\n i held on to that one name . \\n if i kept that in my head , i would be okay . \\n grace . \\n i was shaking , shaking ; my skin was peeling away . \\n grace . \\n my bones squeezed , pinched , pressed against my muscles . \\n grace . \\n her eyes held me even after i stopped feeling her fingers gripping my arms . \\n `` sam , '' she said . \\n `` do n't go . '' \\n chapter thirty-eight grace 38of `` who could do that to a child ? '' \\n mom made a face . \\n i was n't sure if the face was because of what i 'd just told her or because of the pee and antiseptic smell of the hospital . \\n i shrugged and wriggled uncomfortably on the hospital bed . \\n i did n't really need to be here . \\n the gash on my arm had n't even needed stitches . \\n i just wanted to see sam . \\n `` so he 's really messed up then . '' \\n mom frowned at the television above the hospital bed , though it was turned off . \\n she did n't wait for me to respond . \\n `` well , of course . \\n of course he is . \\n he would have to be . \\n you do n't live through that without being messed up . \\n poor kid . \\n he looked like he was really in pain . '' \\n i hoped mom would quit babbling about this by the time sam was done talking to the nurse . \\n i did n't want to think about the curve of his shoulders , the unnatural shape that his body had formed in response to the cold . \\n and i hoped sam would understand why i 'd told mom about his parents-her knowing about them had to be better than her knowing about the wolves . \\n `` i told you , mom . \\n it really bothers him to remember . \\n of course he freaked out when he saw the blood on his arms . \\n it 's classical conditioning , or whatever they call it . \\n google it . '' \\n mom squeezed her arms around herself . \\n `` if he had n't been there , though ... '' `` yes , i would 've died , blah blah blah . \\n but he was there . \\n why is everyone more worked up about this than i am ? '' \\n many of shelby 's teeth marks had already become ugly bruises instead-though i did n't heal nearly as quickly as sam had when he was shot . \\n `` because you have no survival instinct , grace . \\n you 're like a tank , you just chug along , thinking nothing can stop you , until you meet up with a bigger tank . \\n are you sure you want to go out with someone with that kind of history ? '' \\n mom seemed to warm to her theory . \\n `` he could have a psychotic break . \\n i read that people get those when they 're twenty-eight . \\n he could be almost normal and then suddenly go slasher . \\n i mean , you know i 've never told you what to do with your life before now . \\n but what if-what if i asked you to not see him ? '' \\n i had n't expected that . \\n my voice was brittle . \\n `` i would say that by virtue of your not acting parental up to this point , you 've relinquished your ability to wield any power now . \\n sam and i are together . \\n it 's not an option . '' \\n mom threw her hands up as if trying to stop the grace-tank from running over her . \\n `` okay . \\n fine . \\n just be careful , okay ? \\n whatever . \\n i 'm going to go get a drink . '' \\n and just like that , her parental energies were expended . \\n she had played mom by driving us to the hospital , watching the nurse tend to my wounds , and warning me off my psychotic boyfriend , and now she was done . \\n it was obvious i was going to live , so she was off duty . \\n a few minutes after she 'd left , the door clicked open , and sam came to the side of my bed , looking pale and tired under the greenish lights . \\n tired , but human . \\n `` what did they do to you ? '' \\n i asked . \\n his mouth quirked into a smile completely without humor . \\n `` gave me a bandage for a cut that has healed since they put it on . \\n what did you tell her ? '' \\n he glanced around for mom . \\n `` i told her about your parents and said that 's what was wrong with you . \\n she believed me . \\n it 's cool . \\n are you all right ? \\n are you - '' i was n't sure what i was asking . \\n finally , i said , `` dad said she was dead . \\n shelby . \\n i guess she could n't heal like you did . \\n it was too fast . '' \\n sam laid his palms on either side of my neck and kissed me . \\n he pressed his forehead against mine so that we were staring at each other and it looked like he had only one eye . \\n `` i 'm going to hell . '' \\n `` what ? '' \\n his one eye blinked . \\n `` because i should be feeling bad about her being dead . '' \\n i pulled back so i could see his expression ; it was strangely empty . \\n i was n't sure what to say in light of that information , but sam saved me by taking my hands and squeezing them tightly . \\n `` i know i should be upset right now . \\n but i just feel like i 've dodged this huge missile . \\n i did n't change , you 're all right , and for the moment , she 's just one less thing for me to worry about . \\n i just feel-i feel drunk . '' \\n `` mom thinks you 're damaged goods , '' i told him . \\n sam kissed me again , closed his eyes for a moment , and then kissed me a third time , lightly . \\n `` i am . \\n do you want to run away ? '' \\n i did n't know if he meant from the hospital , or from him . \\n `` mr. roth ? '' \\n a nurse appeared in the door . \\n `` you can stay in here , but you should sit down for this . '' \\n like me , sam had to get a series of rabies shots-standard hospital procedure for unprovoked animal attacks . \\n it was n't like we could tell the staff that sam knew the animal personally and that said animal had been homicidal , not rabid . \\n i shuffled over to make room for sam , who sat beside me with an uneasy glance toward the syringe in the nurse 's hands . \\n `` do n't look at the needle , '' the nurse advised as she pushed up his bloody sleeve with rubber-gloved hands . \\n sam looked away , to my face , but his eyes were distant and unfocused , his mind somewhere else as the nurse stuck the needle into his skin . \\n as i watched her depress the syringe , i fantasized that it was a cure for sam-liquid summer injected right into his veins . \\n there was a knock on the door and another nurse stuck her face in . \\n `` brenda , are you done ? '' \\n the second nurse asked . \\n `` i think they need you in 302 . \\n there 's a girl going crazy in there . '' \\n `` oh , wonderful , '' brenda said , with deep sarcasm . \\n `` you two are done . '' \\n to me , she said , `` i 'll get your paperwork to your mom when i 'm done . '' \\n `` thanks , '' sam said , and took my hand . \\n together we walked down the hall , and for a strange moment , it felt like the first night that we 'd met , like no time at all had passed . \\n `` wait , '' i said as we passed through the emergency room waiting area , and sam let me pull him to a halt . \\n i squinted across the busy room , but the woman i thought i 'd seen was gone . \\n `` who are you looking for ? '' \\n `` i thought i saw olivia 's mom . '' \\n i squinted across the waiting room again , but there were only unfamiliar faces . \\n i saw sam 's nostrils flare and his eyebrows draw a little closer to his eyes , but he did n't say anything as we made our way to the glass hospital doors . \\n outside , mom had already pulled the car up to the curb , not knowing what a favor she had done for sam . \\n beyond the car , tiny snowflakes swirled , the cold delicately embodied . \\n sam 's eyes were on the trees on the other side of the parking lot , barely visible in the streetlights . \\n i wondered if he was thinking about the deadly chill that seeped through the cracks in the door , or about shelby 's broken body that would never be human again , or if , like me , he was still thinking about that imaginary syringe full of liquid summer . \\n chapter thirty-nine sam 42of my patchwork life : quiet sunday , coffee on grace 's breath , the unfamiliar landscape of the lumpy new scar on my arm , the dangerous smell of snow in the air . \\n two different worlds circling each other , getting closer and closer , knotting together in ways i 'd never imagined . \\n my near-change of the day before still hung over me , the dusky memory of wolf odor caught in my hair and on the tips of my fingers . \\n it would 've been so easy to give in . \\n even now , twenty-four hours later , i felt like my body was still fighting it . \\n i was so tired . \\n i tried to lose myself in a novel , curled in a squashy leather chair , half dozing . \\n ever since the evening temperatures had begun to pitch sharply downward in the last few days , we 'd been spending our free time in her father 's largely unused study . \\n other than her bedroom , it was the warmest and least drafty place in the house . \\n i liked the room . \\n the walls were lined with dark-spined encyclopedias , too old to be useful , and stacked with dark wooden award plaques for marathon running , too old to be meaningful . \\n the entire study was very small and brown , a rabbit hole made of dark leather , smoky-smelling wood , and manila folders : it was a place to be safe and productive . \\n grace sat at the desk doing homework , her hair illuminated like an old painting by a couple of dull gold desk lamps . \\n the way she sat , head bent in stubborn concentration , held my attention in the way that my book did n't . \\n i realized that grace 's pen had n't moved in a long while . \\n i asked , `` what are you thinking about ? '' \\n she spun the desk chair around to face me and tapped her pen on her lip ; it was a charming gesture that made me want to kiss her . \\n `` washer and dryer . \\n i was thinking about how when i move out , i 'll either have to use the laundromat or buy a washer and dryer . '' \\n i just looked at her , equal parts entranced and horrified by this strange look into the workings of her mind . \\n `` that was distracting you from your homework ? '' \\n `` i was not distracted , '' grace said stiffly . \\n `` i was giving myself a break from reading this stupid short story for english . '' \\n she whirled back around and leaned back over the desk . \\n there was quiet for several long moments ; she still did n't put pen to paper . \\n finally , without lifting her head , she said , `` do you think there 's a cure ? '' \\n i closed my eyes and sighed . \\n `` oh , grace . '' \\n grace persisted , `` tell me , then . \\n is it science ? \\n or is it magic ? \\n what you are ? '' \\n `` does it matter which ? '' \\n `` of course , '' she said , and her voice was frustrated . \\n `` magic would be intangible . \\n science has cures . \\n have n't you ever wondered how it all started ? '' \\n i did n't open my eyes . \\n `` one day a wolf bit a man and the man caught it . \\n magic or science , it 's all the same . \\n the only thing magical about it is that we ca n't explain it . '' \\n grace did n't say anything more , but i could feel her disquiet . \\n i sat there silently , hiding behind my book , knowing that she needed words from me-words i was n't willing to give . \\n i was n't sure which of us was being more selfish-her , for wanting something that no one could promise , or me , for not promising her something that was too painfully impossible to want . \\n before either of us could break the uneasy silence , the door to the study pushed open and her father came in , his wire frames fogged from the temperature change . \\n he scanned the room , taking in the changes we 'd made to it . \\n the underused guitar from her mother 's studio leaning against my chair . \\n my pile of tattered paperbacks on the side table . \\n the neat stack of sharpened pencils on his desk . \\n his eyes lingered on the coffeemaker grace had brought in to satisfy her caffeine cravings ; he seemed as fascinated by it as i had been . \\n a child-sized coffeemaker . \\n for toddlers who needed a quick pick-me-up . \\n `` we 're home . \\n have you guys taken over my room ? '' \\n `` it was being neglected , '' grace said , without looking up from her homework . \\n `` it was too useful to let it go to waste . \\n and now you ca n't have it back . '' \\n `` obviously , '' he observed . \\n he looked at me , sunk into his chair . \\n `` what are you reading ? '' \\n i said , `` bel canto . '' \\n `` i 've never heard of it . \\n what 's it about ? '' \\n he squinted at the cover ; i held it out so that he could see it . \\n `` opera singers and chopping onions . \\n and guns . '' \\n to my surprise , her father 's expression cleared and filled with understanding . \\n `` sounds like something grace 's mother would read . '' \\n grace turned around in the desk chair . \\n `` dad , what did you do with the body ? '' \\n he blinked . \\n `` what ? '' \\n `` after you shot it . \\n what did you do with the body ? '' \\n `` oh . \\n i put it on the deck . '' \\n `` and ? '' \\n `` and what ? '' \\n grace pushed away from the desk , exasperated . \\n `` and what did you do with it after that ? \\n i know you did n't leave it to rot on the deck . '' \\n a slow , sick feeling was beginning to knot in the bottom of my stomach . \\n `` grace , why is this such an issue ? \\n i 'm sure mom took care of it . '' \\n grace pressed her fingers into her forehead . \\n `` dad , how can you think that mom moved it ? \\n she was with us at the hospital ! '' \\n `` i did n't really think about it . \\n i was going to call animal control to pick it up , but it was gone the next morning , so i thought one of you guys must 've called them . '' \\n grace made a little strangled noise . \\n `` dad ! \\n mom ca n't even call to order pizza ! \\n how would she call animal control ? '' \\n her father shrugged and stirred his soup . \\n `` stranger things have happened . \\n it 's not worth getting worked up about , anyway . \\n so it was dragged off the deck by a wild animal . \\n i do n't think other animals can catch rabies from a dead animal . '' \\n grace just crossed her arms and glared at him , as if this comment was just too stupid to dignify with a response . \\n `` do n't sulk , '' he said , and pushed the door farther open with his shoulder to leave . \\n `` it 's not becoming . '' \\n her voice was ice-cold . \\n `` i have to take care of everything myself . '' \\n he smiled at her fondly , somehow reducing the value of her anger . \\n `` we 'd be lost without you , obviously . \\n do n't stay up too late . '' \\n the door softly clicked shut behind him , and grace stared at the bookshelves , the desk , the closed door . \\n anything but my face . \\n i closed my novel without noting the page . \\n `` she 's not dead . '' \\n `` mom might 've called animal control , '' grace said to the desk . \\n `` your mom did n't call animal control . \\n shelby 's alive . '' \\n `` sam . \\n shut up . \\n please . \\n we do n't know . \\n one of the other wolves could 've dragged her body off the deck . \\n do n't jump to conclusions . '' \\n she looked at me , finally , and i saw that grace , despite her complete inability to read people , had puzzled out what shelby was to me . \\n my past clawing out at me , trying to steal me even before winter did . \\n i felt like things were getting away from me . \\n i 'd found heaven and grabbed it as tightly as i could , but it was unraveling , an insubstantial thread sliding between my fingers , too fine to hold . \\n chapter forty sam 58of and so i looked for them . \\n every day that grace was at school , i searched for them , the two wolves i did n't trust , the ones who were supposed to be dead . \\n mercyfalls was small . \\n boundary wood was-not as small , but more familiar , and maybe more willing to give up its secrets to me . \\n i would find shelby and jack and i 'd confront them on my own terms . \\n but shelby had left no trail off the deck , so maybe she really was gone . \\n and jack , too , was nowhere-a dead , cold trail . \\n a ghost that left no corpse behind . \\n i felt like i had combed the entire county for signs of him . \\n i thought-vaguely hoped-that he 'd died , too , and ceased to be a problem . \\n been hit by some department of transportation vehicle and scooped into a dump somewhere . \\n but there were no tracks leading to roads , no trees marked , no scent of a new-made wolf lingering at the school parking lot . \\n he had disappeared as completely as snow in summer . \\n i should 've been glad . \\n disappearing meant discreet . \\n disappearing meant he was n't my problem anymore . \\n but i just could n't accept it . \\n we wolves did many things : change , hide , sing underneath a pale , lonely moon-but we never disappeared entirely . \\n humans disappeared . \\n humans made monsters out of us . \\n chapter forty-one grace 54of sam and i were like horses on a merry-go-round . \\n we followed the same track again and again-home , school , home , school , bookstore , home , school , home , etc.-but really , we were circling the big issue without ever getting any closer to it . \\n the real heart of it : winter . \\n cold . \\n loss . \\n we did n't talk about the looming possibility , but i felt i could always sense the chill of the shadow it cast over us . \\n i 'd read a story once , in a really dire collection of greek myths , about a man called damocles who had a sword dangling over his throne , hung by a single hair . \\n that was us-sam 's humanity dangling by a tight thread . \\n on monday , as per the merry-go-round , it was back to school as usual . \\n although it had only been two days since shelby attacked me , even the bruising had disappeared . \\n it seemed i had a little bit of the werewolf healing in me after all . \\n i was surprised to find olivia absent . \\n last year , she 'd never missed a single day . \\n i kept waiting and waiting for her to walk into one of the two classes we shared before lunch , but she did n't . \\n i kept looking at her empty desk in class . \\n she could 've been just sick , but a part of me that i was trying to ignore said it was more . \\n in fourth period , i slid into my usual seat behind rachel . \\n `` rachel , hey , have you seen olivia ? '' \\n rachel turned to face me . \\n `` huh ? '' \\n `` olivia . \\n does n't she have science with you ? '' \\n she shrugged . \\n `` i have n't heard from her since friday . \\n i tried calling her and her mom said she was sick . \\n but what about you , buttercup ? \\n where were you this weekend ? \\n you never call , you never write . '' \\n `` i got bitten by a raccoon , '' i said . \\n `` i had to get rabies shots and i took sunday to sleep it off . \\n to make sure i did n't start foaming at the mouth and savaging people . '' \\n `` gross . \\n where did it bite you ? '' \\n i gestured toward my jeans . \\n `` ankle . \\n it does n't look like much . \\n i 'm worried about olive , though . \\n i have n't been able to get her on the phone . '' \\n rachel frowned and crossed her legs ; she was , as ever , wearing stripes , this time , striped tights . \\n she said , `` me , neither . \\n do you think she 's avoiding us ? \\n is she still mad at you ? '' \\n i shook my head . \\n `` i do n't think so . '' \\n rachel made a face . \\n `` we 're okay , though , right ? \\n i mean , we have n't really been talking . \\n about stuff , i mean . \\n stuff 's been happening . \\n but we have n't been , you know , talking . \\n or over at each other 's houses . \\n or whatever . '' \\n `` we 're okay , '' i said firmly . \\n she scratched her rainbow tights and bit her lip before saying , `` do you think we should , you know , go over to her house and see if we can catch her ? '' \\n i did n't answer right away , and she did n't push it . \\n this was unfamiliar territory for both of us : we 'd never had to really work to make our trio stick together . \\n i did n't know if tracking olivia down was the right thing or not . \\n it seemed kind of drastic , but how long had it been since we 'd seen her or talked to her , really ? \\n i said , slowly , `` how about we wait until the end of the week ? \\n if we have n't heard from her by then , then we ... ? '' \\n rachel nodded , looking relieved . \\n `` coolio . '' \\n she turned back around in her seat as mr. rink , at the front of the classroom , cleared his throat to get our attention . \\n he said , `` okay , you guys will probably hear this several times today from the teachers , but do n't go around licking the water fountains or kissing perfect strangers , okay ? \\n because the health department has reported a couple of cases of meningitis in this part of the state . \\n and you get that from-anyone ? \\n snot ! \\n mucus ! \\n kissing and licking ! \\n do n't do it ! '' \\n there was appreciative hooting in the back of the classroom . \\n `` since you ca n't do any of that , we 'll do something almost as good . \\n social studies ! \\n open up your books to page one hundred and twelve . '' \\n i glanced at the doorway again for the thousandth time , hoping to see olivia come through it , and opened my book . \\n when classes broke for lunch , i snuck into the hall and phoned olivia 's house . \\n it rang twelve times and went to voicemail . \\n i did n't leave a message ; if she was cutting class for a reason other than sickness , i did n't want her mother to get a message asking where she was during the school day . \\n i was about to shut my locker when i noticed that the smallest pouch of my backpack was partially unzipped . \\n a piece of paper jutted out with my name written on it . \\n i unfolded it , my cheeks warming unexpectedly when i recognized sam 's messy , ropy handwriting . \\n ` again and again , however , we know the language of love , and the little churchyard with its lamenting names and the staggeringly secret abyss in which others find their end : again and again the two of us go out under the ancient trees , make our bed again and again between the flowers , face to face with the skies . ' \\n this is rilke . \\n i wish i had written it for you . \\n i did n't understand it entirely , but , thinking of sam , i read it out loud , whispering the words to myself . \\n in my mouth , the shapes of the words became beautiful . \\n i felt a smile on my face , even with no one around to see it . \\n my worries were still there , but for the moment , i floated above them , warm with the memory of sam . \\n i did n't want to dispel my quiet , buoyant feelings in the noisy cafeteria , so i retreated back to my next period 's empty classroom and took a seat . \\n dropping my english text on the desk , i flattened the note on my desk to read it again . \\n sitting in the empty classroom and listening to the faraway sounds of noisy students in the cafeteria , i was reminded of feeling sick in class and being sent to the school nurse . \\n the nurse 's office had that same muffled sense of distance , like a satellite to the loud planet that was the school . \\n i had spent a lot of time there after the wolves attacked me , suffering from that flu that probably had n't really been a flu . \\n for a measureless amount of time , i stared at the open cell phone , thinking about getting bitten . \\n about getting sick from it . \\n about getting better . \\n why was i the only one who had ? \\n `` have you changed your mind ? '' \\n my chin jerked up at the sound of the voice , and i found myself facing isabel at the desk next to mine . \\n to my surprise , she did n't look quite as perfect as usual ; she had bags under her eyes that were only partially hidden by makeup , and there was nothing to disguise her bloodshot eyes . \\n `` excuse me ? '' \\n `` about jack . \\n about knowing anything about him . '' \\n i looked at her , wary . \\n i had heard once that lawyers never ask a question they did n't already know the answer to , and isabel 's voice was surprisingly sure . \\n she reached a long , unnaturally tanned arm into her bag and pulled out a sheaf of paper . \\n she tossed it on top of my poetry book . \\n `` your friend dropped these . '' \\n it took me a moment to realize that it was a stack of glossy photo paper and that these images in front of me must 've been digital prints of olivia 's . \\n my stomach flip-flopped . \\n the first few photos were of woods , nothing particularly remarkable . \\n then there were the wolves . \\n the crazy brindle wolf , half-hidden by trees . \\n and that black wolf-had sam told me his name ? \\n i hesitated , my fingers on the edge of the page , ready to flip to the next one . \\n isabel had tensed visibly next to me , preparing for me to see what was on the next sheet . \\n i knew whatever olivia had caught on film was going to be difficult to explain . \\n finally , impatient , isabel leaned across the aisle and snatched the top few prints from the stack . \\n `` just turn the page . '' \\n it was a photo of jack . \\n jack as a wolf . \\n a close-up of his eyes in a wolf 's face . \\n and the next one was of jack himself . \\n as a person . \\n naked . \\n the shot had a kind of raw , artistic power , almost posed-looking , the way jack 's arms curled around his body , his head turned back over his shoulder toward the camera , showing scratches on the long , pale curve of his back . \\n i chewed my lip and looked at his face in both of them . \\n no shot of him changing , but the similarity of the eyes was devastating . \\n that close-up of the wolf 's face-that was the money shot . \\n and then it hit me , what these photos really meant , the true importance . \\n not that isabel knew . \\n but that olivia did . \\n olivia had taken these photos , so of course she must know . \\n but for how long , and why had n't she told me ? \\n `` say something . '' \\n finally , i looked up from the photos to isabel . \\n `` what do you want me to say ? '' \\n isabel made an irritated little noise . \\n `` you see the photos . \\n he 's alive . \\n he 's right there . '' \\n i looked back at jack , staring out of the woods . \\n he looked cold in his new skin . \\n `` i do n't know what you want me to say . \\n what do you want from me ? '' \\n she seemed to be struggling with herself . \\n for a second , she looked like she might snap at me , and then she closed her eyes . \\n she opened them and looked away , at the whiteboard . \\n `` you do n't have a brother , do you ? \\n any siblings , right ? '' \\n `` no . \\n i 'm an only child . '' \\n isabel shrugged . \\n `` then i do n't know how i can explain . \\n he 's my brother . \\n i thought he was dead . \\n but he 's not . \\n he 's alive . \\n he 's right there , but i do n't know where there is . \\n i do n't know what that is . \\n but i think-i think you do . \\n only you wo n't help me . '' \\n she looked at me and her eyes flashed , fierce . \\n `` what have i ever done to you ? '' \\n i stumbled over the words . \\n the truth was , jack was her brother . \\n it seemed like she ought to know . \\n if only it was n't isabel asking . \\n i said , `` isabel ... you have to know why i 'm afraid to talk to you . \\n i know you have n't done anything to me personally . \\n but i know people you 've destroyed . \\n just ... tell me why i should trust you . '' \\n isabel snatched back the photos and stuffed them back in her bag . \\n `` what you said . \\n because i 've never done anything to you . \\n or maybe because i think whatever 's wrong with jack-i think that 's what 's wrong with your boyfriend , too . '' \\n i was abnormally paralyzed by the thought of the photos that i had n't seen in that stack . \\n was sam in there ? \\n maybe olivia had known about the wolves for longer than i had-i tried to replay exactly what olivia had said during our argument , trying to remember any double meaning . \\n isabel was staring at me , waiting for me to say something , and i did n't know what to say . \\n finally , i snapped , `` okay , stop staring at me . \\n let me think . '' \\n the classroom door thumped as students began strolling in for class . \\n i ripped a page out of my notebook and jotted my phone number on it . \\n `` that 's my cell . \\n call me after school sometime and we 'll figure out someplace to meet . \\n i guess . '' \\n isabel took the number . \\n i expected to see satisfaction on her face , but to my surprise , she looked as sick as i felt . \\n the wolves were a secret no one wanted to share . \\n `` we have a problem . '' \\n sam turned in the driver 's seat to look at me . \\n `` are n't you supposed to still be in class ? '' \\n `` i got out early . '' \\n last class was art . \\n nobody was going to miss me and my hideous clay-and-wire sculpture , anyway . \\n `` isabel knows . '' \\n sam blinked , slowly . \\n `` who 's isabel ? '' \\n `` jack 's sister , remember ? '' \\n i turned down the heat-sam had it set to hell-and shoved my backpack down by my feet . \\n i explained the confrontation to him , leaving out how creepy the jack-human photo was . \\n `` i have no idea what the other photos were . '' \\n sam immediately bypassed the isabel question . \\n `` they were olivia 's photos ? '' \\n `` yeah . '' \\n worry was written all over his face . \\n `` i wonder if this has something to do with the way olivia was at the bookstore . \\n with me . '' \\n when i did n't answer , he looked at the steering wheel , or at something just past it . \\n `` if she knew what we were , it makes her entire eye comment very logical . \\n she was trying to get us to confess . '' \\n i said , `` yeah , actually . \\n that would make a lot of sense . '' \\n he sighed heavily . \\n `` suddenly i 'm thinking about what rachel said . \\n about the wolf that was at olivia 's house . '' \\n i closed my eyes and opened them again , still seeing the image of jack with his arms wrapped around himself . \\n `` ugh . \\n i do n't want to think about that . \\n what about isabel ? \\n i ca n't really avoid her . \\n and i ca n't keep lying ; i just look like an idiot . '' \\n sam half smiled at me . \\n `` well , i would ask you what sort of person she is and what you thought we ought to do - '' '' - but i suck at reading people , '' i finished for him . \\n `` you said it , not me . \\n just remember that . '' \\n `` okay , so what do we do ? \\n why do i feel like i 'm the only one in panic mode here ? \\n you 're completely ... calm . '' \\n sam shrugged . \\n `` total lack of preparedness for such a thing , probably . \\n i do n't think i know what to plan for without meeting her . \\n if i had talked to her when she had the photos , maybe i 'd be worried , but right now , i ca n't think of it concretely . \\n i do n't know , isabel sounds like a pleasant sort of name . '' \\n i laughed . \\n `` barking up the wrong tree there . '' \\n he made a melodramatic face , and the twisted rueful agony in it was so overdone that it made me feel better . \\n `` is she awful ? '' \\n `` i used to think so . \\n now ? '' \\n i shrugged . \\n `` jury 's still out . \\n so what do we do ? '' \\n `` i think we have to meet her . '' \\n `` both of us ? \\n where ? '' \\n `` yes , both . \\n this is n't just your problem . \\n i dunno . \\n someplace quiet . \\n someplace i can get a feel for her before we decide what to tell her . '' \\n he frowned . \\n `` she would n't be the first family member to find out . '' \\n i knew from his frown that he could n't be talking about his parents-his expression would n't have changed if he had . \\n `` she would n't ? '' \\n `` beck 's wife knew . '' \\n `` past tense ? '' \\n `` breast cancer . \\n it was long before me . \\n i never knew her . \\n i only found out about her from paul , and by accident then . \\n beck did n't want me to know about her . \\n i guess because most people do n't do well with us , and he did n't want me thinking i could just go out and get me a nice little wife of my own , or something . '' \\n it seemed unfair , that two such tragedies should strike a couple . \\n i realized , too late to comment on it , that i 'd almost missed the unfamiliar bitterness in his voice . \\n i thought about saying something , asking him about beck , but the moment was gone , lost in noise as sam turned up the radio and hit the accelerator . \\n he backed the bronco out of the parking space , his forehead furrowed with thought . \\n `` to heck with the rules , '' sam said . \\n `` i want to meet her . '' \\n chapter forty-two sam 54of the first words i ever heard isabel say were : `` can i ask why the hell we 're making quiche instead of talking about my brother ? '' \\n she had just climbed out of a massive white suv that basically took over the brisbanes ' entire driveway . \\n my first impression of her was tall-probably because of the five-inch heels on the ass-kicking boots she wore-followed by ringlets-because her head had more of them than a porcelain doll . \\n `` no , '' grace said , and i loved her because of the way she said it , no negotiation allowed . \\n isabel made a noise that , if converted into a missile , had enough vitriol to obliterate a small country . \\n `` so can i ask who he is ? '' \\n i glanced at her in time to see her checking out my butt . \\n she looked away quickly as i echoed , `` no . '' \\n grace led us into the house . \\n turning to isabel in the front hallway , she said , `` do n't ask any questions about jack . \\n my mom 's home . '' \\n `` is that you , grace ? '' \\n grace 's mom called from upstairs . \\n `` yes ! \\n we 're making quiche ! '' \\n grace hung up her coat and motioned for us to do the same . \\n `` i brought some stuff back from the studio , just shove it out of your way ! '' \\n her mom shouted back . \\n isabel wrinkled her nose and kept her fur-lined jacket on , stuffing her hands in the pockets and standing back while grace shoved boxes toward the walls of the room to clear a path through the clutter . \\n isabel looked profoundly out of place in the comfortably crowded kitchen . \\n i could n't decide whether her perfect artificial ringlets made the not-quite-white linoleum floor look more pathetic or whether the old cracked floor made her hair look more perfect and fake . \\n until now , i had n't ever seen the kitchen as shabby . \\n isabel shuffled back even farther as grace shoved up her sleeves and washed her hands at the sink . \\n `` sam , turn on that radio and find something good , will you ? '' \\n i found a little boom box on the counter amongst some tins of salt and sugar and turned it on . \\n `` god , we really are going to make quiche , '' isabel moaned . \\n `` i thought it was code for something else . '' \\n i grinned at her and she caught my eye and made an anguished face . \\n but her expression was too much-i did n't believe her angst entirely . \\n something in her eyes made me think she was at least curious about the situation . \\n and the situation was this : i was n't going to confide in isabel until i was damn certain what kind of person she was . \\n grace 's mom came in then , smelling of orange-scented turps . \\n `` hi , sam . \\n you 're making quiche , too ? '' \\n `` trying , '' i said earnestly . \\n she laughed . \\n `` how fun . \\n who 's this ? '' \\n `` isabel , '' grace said . \\n `` mom , do you know where that green cookbook is ? \\n i had it right here forever . \\n it 's got the quiche recipe in it . '' \\n her mom shrugged helplessly and knelt by one of the boxes on the floor . \\n `` it must 've walked off . \\n what in the world is on the radio ? \\n sam , you can make it do something better than that . '' \\n while grace fumbled through some cookbooks tucked away on a corner of the counter , i clicked through the radio stations until grace 's mom said , `` stop right there ! '' \\n when i got to some rather funky-sounding pop station . \\n she stood , holding a box . \\n `` i think my work here is done . \\n have fun , kids . \\n i 'll be back ... sometime . '' \\n grace barely seemed to notice her leaving . \\n she gestured at me . \\n `` isabel , eggs and cheese and milk are in the fridge . \\n sam , we need to make plain old piecrusts . \\n would you preheat the oven to four-fifty and get us some pans ? '' \\n isabel was staring inside the fridge . \\n `` there 's , like , eight thousand kinds of cheese in here . \\n it all looks the same to me . '' \\n `` you do the oven , let sam get the cheese and stuff . \\n he knows food , '' grace said . \\n she was standing on her tiptoes to get flour out of an overhead cupboard ; it stretched her body gorgeously and made me want in the worst way to touch the bare skin exposed on her lower back . \\n but then she heaved the flour down and i 'd missed my chance , so i traded places with isabel , grabbed some sharp cheddar and eggs and milk , and threw it all on the counter . \\n grace was already involved with cutting shortening and flour in a bowl by the time i 'd finished cracking eggs and whisking in some mayonnaise . \\n the kitchen was suddenly full of activity , as if we were legion . \\n `` what the hell is this ? '' \\n isabel demanded , staring at a package grace had handed her . \\n grace snorted with laughter . \\n `` it 's a mushroom . '' \\n `` it looks like it came out of a cow 's rear end . '' \\n `` i 'd like that cow , '' grace said , leaning past isabel to slap some butter into a saucepan . \\n `` its butt would be worth a million . \\n saute those in there for a few minutes till they 're nice and yummy . '' \\n `` how long ? '' \\n `` till they 're yummy , '' i repeated . \\n `` you heard the boy , '' grace said . \\n she reached out a hand . \\n `` pan ! '' \\n `` help her , '' i told isabel . \\n `` i 'll take care of yummy , since you ca n't . '' \\n `` i 'm already yummy , '' muttered isabel . \\n she handed two pans to grace , and grace deftly unfolded the pie pastry-magic-into the bottom of each . \\n she began to show isabel how to crimp the edges . \\n the entire process seemed very wellworn ; i got the idea that grace could 've done this whole thing a lot faster without me and isabel in her way . \\n isabel caught me smiling at the sight of the two of them crimping piecrusts . \\n `` what are you smiling at ? \\n look at your mushrooms ! '' \\n i rescued the mushrooms in time and added the spinach that grace pushed into my hands . \\n `` my mascara . '' \\n isabel 's voice rose above the increasing clamor , and i looked to see her and grace laughing and crying while cutting onions . \\n then the little onions ' powerful odor hit my nose and burned my eyes , too . \\n i offered my saute pan to them . \\n `` throw them in here . \\n it 'll kill it a bit . '' \\n isabel scraped them off a cutting board into the pan and grace slapped my butt with a flour-covered hand . \\n i craned my neck , trying to see if she 'd left a print , while grace rubbed her hand in leftover flour to get better coverage and tried again . \\n `` this is my song ! '' \\n grace suddenly announced . \\n `` turn it up ! \\n turn it up ! '' \\n it was mariah carey in the worst possible way , but it was so right at the moment . \\n i turned it up until the little speakers buzzed against the tins next to them . \\n i grabbed grace 's hand and tugged her over to me and we started to dance like we were cool , terribly clumsy and unbearably sexy , her grinding up against me , hands in the air , my arms around her waist , too low to be chaste . \\n i thought to myself , a life is measured by moments like these . \\n grace leaned her head back , neck long and pale against my shoulder , to reach my mouth for a kiss , and just before i gave her one , i saw isabel 's wistful eyes watch my mouth touch grace 's . \\n `` tell me how long to set the timer for , '' isabel said , catching my eye and looking away . \\n `` and then maybe we can talk ... ? '' \\n grace was still leaning back against me , secure in my arms , covered in flour and so entirely edible that i ached with wanting to be alone with her , here , now . \\n she gestured lazily toward the open cookbook on the counter , drunk with my presence . \\n isabel consulted the recipe and set the timer . \\n there was a moment 's silence when we realized we were done , and then i took a breath and faced isabel . \\n `` okay , i 'll tell you what 's wrong with jack . '' \\n isabel and grace both looked startled . \\n `` let 's go sit down , '' grace suggested , removing herself from my arms . \\n `` living room 's that way . \\n i 'll get coffee . '' \\n so isabel and i made our way into the living room . \\n like the kitchen , it was cluttered in a way i had n't noticed until isabel was in it . \\n she had to move a pile of unfolded laundry to sit on the sofa . \\n i did n't want to sit next to her , so i sat on the rocker across from her . \\n looking at me out of the corner of her eye , isabel asked , `` why are n't you like jack ? \\n why are n't you changing back and forth ? '' \\n i did n't flinch ; if grace had n't warned me of how much isabel had guessed , i probably would have . \\n `` i 've been this way longer . \\n you get more stable the longer it 's been . \\n at first you just switch back and forth all the time . \\n temperature has a little bit to do with it , but not as much as later . '' \\n she immediately fired another one off : `` did you do this to jack ? '' \\n i let the revulsion show on my face . \\n `` i do n't know who did it . \\n there are quite a few of us and not all of us are nice people . '' \\n i did n't say anything about his bb gun . \\n `` why is he so angry ? '' \\n i shrugged . \\n `` i dunno . \\n because he 's an angry person ? '' \\n isabel 's expression became ... pointy . \\n `` look , getting bitten does n't make you into a monster . \\n it just makes you into a wolf . \\n you are what you are . \\n when you 're a wolf , or when you 're shifting , you do n't have human inhibitions , so if you 're naturally angry or violent , you get worse . '' \\n grace walked in , precariously carrying three mugs of coffee . \\n isabel took one with a beaver on the side and i took one with a bank name on it . \\n grace joined isabel on the sofa . \\n isabel closed her eyes for a second . \\n `` okay . \\n so let me get this straight . \\n my brother was n't really killed by wolves . \\n he was just mauled by them and then turned into a werewolf ? \\n sorry , i 'm missing the whole undead thing . \\n and is n't there supposed to be something about moons and silver bullets and a bunch of crap like that ? '' \\n `` he healed himself , but it took a while , '' i told her . \\n `` he was n't ever really dead . \\n i do n't know how he escaped from the morgue . \\n the moon and silver stuff is all just myth . \\n i do n't know how to explain it . \\n it 's - it 's a disease that 's worse when it 's cold . \\n i think the moon myth is because it gets cold overnight , so when we 're new , we change into wolves overnight a lot . \\n so people thought it was the moon that caused it . '' \\n isabel seemed to be taking this pretty well . \\n she was n't fainting , and she did n't smell afraid . \\n she sipped her coffee . \\n `` grace , this is disgusting . '' \\n `` it 's instant , '' grace apologized . \\n isabel asked , `` so does my brother recognize me when he 's a wolf ? '' \\n grace looked at my face ; i could n't look back at her when i answered . \\n `` probably a little . \\n some of us do n't remember anything about our lives when we 're wolves . \\n some of us remember a little . '' \\n grace looked away , sipped her coffee , pretended she did n't care . \\n `` so there 's a pack ? '' \\n isabel asked good questions . \\n i nodded . \\n `` but jack has n't found them yet . \\n or they have n't found him . '' \\n isabel ran a finger around the rim of her coffee mug for a long moment . \\n finally she looked from me to grace and back again . \\n `` okay , so what 's the catch here ? '' \\n i blinked . \\n `` what do you mean ? '' \\n `` i mean , you 're sitting here just talking , and grace is here trying to pretend like everything 's just fine , but everything is n't just fine , is it ? '' \\n i guess i could n't be surprised by her intuition . \\n you did n't claw your way to the top of the high school food chain without being able to read people . \\n i looked into my still-full coffee cup . \\n i did n't like coffee-too strong and bitter a flavor . \\n i 'd been a wolf too long ; i 'd lost my taste for it . \\n `` we 've got expiration dates . \\n the longer it 's been since we 've been bitten , the less cold we need to turn us into wolves . \\n and the more heat we need to turn us into humans . \\n eventually , we just do n't turn , become human again . '' \\n `` how long ? '' \\n i did n't look at grace . \\n `` it varies from wolf to wolf . \\n years and years for most wolves . '' \\n `` but not for you . '' \\n shut up , isabel . \\n i did n't want to test grace 's even expression any further . \\n i just shook my head , very slightly , hoping that grace really was looking out the window and not at me . \\n `` so what if you lived in florida , or someplace really warm ? '' \\n i was relieved to get the topic off me . \\n `` a couple of us tried it . \\n it does n't work . \\n it just makes you supersensitive to the slightest temperature change . '' \\n ulrik and melissa and a wolf named bauer had gone down to texas one year in hopes of outrunning the winter . \\n i still remembered the excited phone call from ulrik after weeks of not changing-and then his dejected return , minus bauer , after they 'd walked past the slightly ajar door of an air-conditioned shop and bauer had instantly changed forms . \\n apparently , texas animal control did n't believe in tranquilizer guns . \\n `` what about the equator ? \\n where the temperature never changes ? '' \\n `` i do n't know . '' \\n i tried not to sound exasperated . \\n `` none of us ever decided to go to the rain forest , but i 'll keep that in mind for when i win the lotto . '' \\n `` no need to be a jerk , '' isabel said , setting her coffee mug down on a stack of magazines . \\n `` i was just asking . \\n so anybody who gets bitten changes , then ? '' \\n everyone except the one i wish i could take with me . \\n `` pretty much . '' \\n i heard my voice , how tired it sounded , and did n't care . \\n isabel pursed her lips and i thought she 'd press it further , but she did n't . \\n `` so that 's really it . \\n my brother 's a werewolf , a real werewolf , and there 's no cure . '' \\n grace 's eyes narrowed , and i wished i knew what she was thinking . \\n `` yeah . \\n you got it . \\n but you already knew all this . \\n so why did you ask us ? '' \\n isabel shrugged . \\n `` i guess i was waiting for someone to jump out of the curtain and say , ` whoopdie-friggin-doo , fooled you ! \\n no such thing as werewolves . \\n what were you thinking ? ' '' \\n i wanted to tell her that there really was n't such thing as werewolves . \\n that there were humans , and there were wolves , and there were those of us that were on the way from one to another . \\n but i was just tired , so i did n't say anything . \\n `` tell me you wo n't tell anyone . '' \\n grace spoke abruptly . \\n `` i do n't think you have yet , but you ca n't tell anyone now . '' \\n `` do you think i 'm an idiot ? \\n my dad fricking shot one of the wolves because he was angry about it . \\n do you think i 'm going to try and tell him jack 's one of them ? \\n and my mother 's already medicated out the wazoo . \\n yeah , big help she would be . \\n i 'm just going to have to deal with this on my own . '' \\n grace exchanged a look with me that said , good guess , sam . \\n `` and with us , '' grace added . \\n `` we 'll help you when we can . \\n jack does n't have to be alone , but we have to find him first . '' \\n isabel flicked an invisible piece of dust off one of her boots , as if she did n't know what to do with the kindness . \\n finally , she said , still looking at her boot , `` i do n't know . \\n he was n't a very nice person last time i saw him . \\n i do n't know if i want to find him . '' \\n `` sorry , '' i said . \\n `` for what ? '' \\n for not being able to tell you that his nasty temper was from the bite and would go away . \\n i shrugged . \\n it felt like i was doing a lot of that . \\n `` for not having happier news . '' \\n there was a low , irritating buzz from the kitchen . \\n `` the quiche is done , '' isabel said . \\n `` at least i get a consolation prize . '' \\n she looked at me and then at grace . \\n `` so soon he 'll stop switching back and forth , right ? \\n because winter 's almost here ? '' \\n i nodded . \\n `` good , '' isabel said , looking out the window at the na ** d branches of the trees . \\n looking out to the woods that were jack 's home now , and soon , mine . \\n `` ca n't get here soon enough . '' \\n chapter forty-three grace 45of i was a zombie of sleeplessness . \\n i was english essay mr. rink 's voice flickering fluorescent light above my desk ap biology isabel 's stone face heavy eyes `` earth to grace , '' rachel said , pinching my elbow as she passed me on the sidewalk . \\n `` there 's olivia . \\n i did n't even see her in class , did you ? '' \\n i followed rachel 's gaze to the kids waiting for the school bus . \\n olivia was among them , jumping up and down to stay warm . \\n no camera . \\n i thought about the photos . \\n `` i have to talk to her . '' \\n `` yes . \\n you do , '' rachel said . \\n `` because you need to be on speaking terms before our vacation to hot , sunny places this christmas . \\n i would go with you , but dad 's waiting , and he 's got an appointment in duluth . \\n he 'll go all fanged if i do n't get out there this second . \\n tell me what she says ! '' \\n she ran toward the parking lot and i jogged toward olivia . \\n `` olivia . '' \\n she jerked , and i caught her elbow , as if she would fly away if i did n't . \\n `` i 've been trying to call you . '' \\n olivia pulled her stocking cap down and balled herself up against the chill . \\n `` yeah ? '' \\n for a single moment , i thought about waiting to see what she would say . \\n to see if she would confess to knowledge about the wolves without prompting . \\n but the buses were pulling in , and i did n't want to wait . \\n i lowered my voice and said in her ear , `` i saw your photographs . \\n of jack . '' \\n she abruptly turned to face me . \\n `` you were the one who took them ? '' \\n i tried , with some success , to keep the accusation out of my voice . \\n `` isabel showed them to me . '' \\n olivia 's face went pale . \\n i demanded , `` why would n't you tell me ? \\n why would n't you call me ? '' \\n she bit her lip and looked across the parking lot . \\n `` i was going to , at first . \\n to tell you that you were right . \\n but then i ran across jack , and he told me i could n't tell anyone about him , and i just felt guilty , like i was doing something wrong . '' \\n i stared at her . \\n `` have you talked to him ? '' \\n olivia shrugged , unhappy , and shivered in the growing chill of the afternoon . \\n `` i was taking photos of the wolves , like always , and i saw him . \\n i saw him '' - she lowered her voice and leaned toward me - `` change . \\n become human again . \\n i could n't believe it . \\n and he had no clothing , and my house was n't far , so i had him come over and get some of john 's clothes . \\n i guess i was just trying to convince myself that i was n't crazy . '' \\n `` thanks , '' i said sarcastically . \\n it took her a moment . \\n then she said , quickly , `` oh , grace , i know . \\n i know you told me at the very beginning , but what was i supposed to do-believe you ? \\n it sounds impossible . \\n it looks impossible . \\n but i felt sorry for him . \\n he does n't belong anywhere now . '' \\n `` how long has this been going on ?! '' \\n something was stinging at me . \\n betrayal , or something . \\n i 'd told olivia at the very beginning about my suspicions , and she 'd waited until i came to her to admit anything . \\n `` i do n't know . \\n awhile . \\n i 've been giving him food and washing his clothes and stuff . \\n i do n't know where he 's been staying . \\n we talked a lot , until we had a fight about the cure . \\n i was cutting class to talk to him and to try to get more photos of the wolves . \\n i wanted to see if any of the others would change . '' \\n she paused . \\n `` grace , he said you 'd been bitten and cured . '' \\n `` that 's true . \\n well , that i was bitten . \\n you knew that . \\n but i did n't ever change into a wolf , obviously . '' \\n her eyes were intent on me . \\n `` ever ? '' \\n i shook my head . \\n `` no . \\n have you told anybody else ? '' \\n olivia gave me another withering look . \\n `` i 'm not an idiot . '' \\n `` well , isabel got those photos somehow . \\n if she can , anyone can . '' \\n `` i do n't have any photos that really show what 's going on , '' olivia said . \\n `` i told you , i 'm not a total idiot . \\n i just have the photos of the before and after . \\n and who would believe anything from that ? '' \\n `` isabel , '' i said . \\n olivia frowned at me . \\n `` i 'm being careful . \\n anyway , i have n't seen him since we fought . \\n i have to go . '' \\n she gestured at the bus . \\n `` you really never changed ? '' \\n now it was my turn to give her a withering look . \\n `` i never lie to you , olive . '' \\n she looked at me for a long beat . \\n then she said , `` do you want to come back to my house ? '' \\n i kind of wanted her to say that she was sorry . \\n for not confiding in me . \\n for not answering my calls . \\n for fighting with me . \\n for not saying you were right . \\n so i just said , `` i 'm waiting for sam . '' \\n `` okay . \\n maybe another day this week ? '' \\n i blinked . \\n `` maybe . '' \\n and then she was gone , onto the bus , just a silhouette in the windows making her way toward the back . \\n i had thought that hearing her admit to knowing about the wolves would give me some ... closure , but all i felt was an uneasy disquiet . \\n after all this time looking for jack , and olivia had known where to find him all along . \\n i was n't sure what to think . \\n in the parking lot , i saw the bronco pulling in slowly , heading in my direction . \\n seeing sam behind the wheel gave me peace in a way that the conversation with olivia had n't . \\n strange how just seeing my own car could make me so happy . \\n sam leaned over to unlatch the passenger-side door for me . \\n he still looked a little tired . \\n he handed me a steaming styrofoam cup of coffee . \\n `` your phone rang just a few minutes ago . '' \\n `` thanks . '' \\n i climbed into the bronco and gratefully accepted the coffee . \\n `` i 'm a zombie today . \\n i was dying for caffeine and i just had the weirdest conversation with olivia . \\n i 'll tell you about it once i 'm properly caffeinated . \\n where 's my phone ? '' \\n sam pointed to the glove compartment . \\n climbing into the bronco , i opened the glove compartment and retrieved the phone . \\n one new message . \\n i dialed my voicemail , put it on speakerphone , and set the phone on the dash while i turned to sam . \\n `` i 'm ready now , '' i told him . \\n sam looked at me , eyebrows doubtful . \\n `` for ? '' \\n `` my kiss . '' \\n sam chewed his lip . \\n `` i prefer the surprise attack . '' \\n `` you have one new message , '' said the recorded cell phone babe . \\n i grimaced , throwing myself back in the seat . \\n `` you drive me crazy . '' \\n he grinned . \\n `` hi , honey ! \\n you 'll never guess who i ran into today ! '' \\n mom 's voice buzzed out of the cell phone speaker . \\n `` you could just throw yourself at me , '' i suggested . \\n `` that would be fine with me . '' \\n mom sounded excited . \\n `` naomi ett ! \\n you know , from my school . '' \\n `` i did n't think you were that sort of girl , '' sam said . \\n i thought he might be joking . \\n mom continued , `` she 's all married and everything now , and in town for just a little bit , so dad and i are going to spend some time with her . '' \\n i frowned at him . \\n `` i 'm not . \\n but with you , all bets are off . '' \\n `` so we wo n't be back until late tonight , '' mom 's message concluded . \\n `` remember there 's leftovers in the fridge , and of course , we have our phone if you need us . '' \\n my leftovers . \\n from the casserole i 'd made . \\n sam was staring at the phone as cell phone babe took up where mom had left off . \\n `` to hear this message again , press one . \\n to delete this message ... '' i deleted it . \\n sam was still looking at the phone , his eyes sort of distant . \\n i did n't know what he was thinking . \\n maybe , like me , his head was full of a dozen different problems , all too amorphous and intangible to be solved . \\n i snapped the phone shut , and the sound seemed to break his spell . \\n sam 's eyes were suddenly intense on me . \\n `` come away with me . '' \\n i raised an eyebrow . \\n `` no , seriously . \\n let 's go somewhere . \\n can i take you somewhere , tonight ? \\n someplace better than leftovers ? '' \\n i did n't know what to say . \\n i think maybe what i wanted to say was , do you really think you have to even ask ? \\n i watched him intently while sam babbled on , words tumbling over each other in their hurry to get out . \\n if i had n't scented the air at that moment , i probably would n't have realized that anything was wrong . \\n but coming off him in waves was the too-sweet scent of anxiety . \\n anxious about me ? \\n anxious about something that had happened today ? \\n anxious because he had heard the weather report ? \\n `` what 's up ? '' \\n i asked . \\n `` i just want to get out of town tonight . \\n i want to just get away for a little bit . \\n mini vacation . \\n a few hours in someone else 's life , you know ? \\n i mean , we do n't have to if you do n't want to . \\n and if you think that it 's not - '' `` sam , '' i said . \\n `` shut up . '' \\n he shut up . \\n `` start driving . '' \\n we started driving . \\n sam got onto the interstate and we drove and drove until the sky grew pink above the trees and birds flying over the road were black silhouettes . \\n it was cold enough that cars just getting onto the highway puffed visible white exhaust into the frosty air . \\n sam used one hand to drive and used the other to twine his fingers with mine . \\n this was so much better than staying at home with a casserole . \\n by the time we got off the interstate , i had either gotten used to the smell of sam 's anxiety , or he had calmed down , because the only odor in the car was his musky , wolf wood scent . \\n `` so , '' i said , and ran a finger over the back of his cool hand . \\n `` where are we going , anyway ? '' \\n sam glanced over at me , the dash lights illuminating his doleful smile . \\n `` there 's a wonderful candy shop in duluth . '' \\n it was incredibly cute that he 'd driven us an hour just to go to a candy shop . \\n incredibly stupid , given the weather report , but incredibly cute nonetheless . \\n `` i 've never been . '' \\n `` they have the most amazing caramel apples , '' sam promised . \\n `` and these gooey things , i do n't even know what they are . \\n probably a million calories . \\n and hot chocolate-oh , man , grace . \\n it 's amazing . '' \\n i could n't think of anything to say . \\n i was idiotically entranced by the way he said `` grace . '' \\n the tone of it . \\n the way his lips formed the vowels . \\n the timbre of his voice stuck in my head like music . \\n `` i even wrote a song about their truffles , '' he confessed . \\n that caught my attention . \\n `` i heard you playing the guitar for my mom . \\n she told me it was a song about me . \\n why do n't you ever sing it for me ? '' \\n sam shrugged . \\n i looked past him at the brilliantly illuminated city , every building and bridge lit bravely against the early winter darkness ; we were heading downtown . \\n i could n't remember the last time i 'd been there . \\n `` it would be very romantic . \\n and add to your walking stereotype street cred . '' \\n sam did n't look away from the road , but his lips curled up . \\n i grinned , then looked away to watch our progress downtown . \\n he did n't even look at the road signs as he navigated his way down the evening streets . \\n streetlights striped light across the windshield and the white lines striped below us , marking time above and below . \\n finally , he parallel parked and gestured to a warmly lit shop a few doors ahead of us . \\n he turned to me . \\n `` heaven . '' \\n together we got out of the car and jogged the distance . \\n i did n't know how cold it was , but my breath formed a shapeless cloud in front of me as i pushed open the glass door to the candy shop . \\n sam pushed into the warm yellow glow after me , arms clasped around himself . \\n the bell was still dinging from our entrance when sam came from behind me and pulled me to him , crushing his arms over my chest . \\n he whispered in my ear , `` do n't look . \\n close your eyes and smell it . \\n really smell it . \\n i know you can . '' \\n i leaned my head back against his shoulder , feeling the heat of his body against me , and closed my eyes . \\n my nose was inches away from the skin on his neck , and that was what i smelled . \\n earthy , wild , complex . \\n `` not me , '' he said . \\n `` it 's all i smell , '' i murmured , opening my eyes to look up at him . \\n `` do n't be stubborn . '' \\n sam turned me slightly , so that i was facing the center of the shop ; i saw shelves of tinned cookies and candies and the glint of a glass candy counter beyond them . \\n `` give in for once . \\n it 's worth it . '' \\n his sad eyes implored me to explore something i 'd left untouched for years . \\n something more than untouched-something i 'd buried alive . \\n buried when i had thought i was alone . \\n now i had sam behind me , holding me tightly to his chest as if he held me upright , his breath blowing warm over my ear . \\n i closed my eyes , flared my nostrils , and let the scents flood in . \\n the strongest of them , caramel and brown sugar , smell as yellow-orange as the sun , came first . \\n that one was easy . \\n the one that anyone would notice coming into the shop . \\n and then chocolate , of course , the bitter dark and the sugary milk chocolate . \\n i do n't think a normal girl would 've smelled anything else , and part of me wanted to stop there . \\n but i could feel sam 's heart pounding behind me , and for once , i gave in . \\n peppermint swirled into my nostrils , sharp as glass , then raspberry , almost too sweet , like too-ripe fruit . \\n apple , crisp and pure . \\n nuts , buttery , warm , earthy , like sam . \\n the subtle , mild scent of white chocolate . \\n oh , god , some sort of mocha , rich and dark and sinful . \\n i sighed with pleasure , but there was more . \\n the butter cookies on the shelves added a floury , comforting scent , and the lollipops , a riot of fruit scents too concentrated to be real . \\n the salty bite of pretzels , the bright smell of lemon , the brittle edge of anise . \\n smells i did n't even know names for . \\n i groaned . \\n sam rewarded me with the lightest of kisses on my ear before he spoke into it . \\n `` is n't it amazing ? '' \\n i opened my eyes ; colors seemed dull in comparison with what i had just experienced . \\n i could n't think of anything that did n't sound trivial , so i just nodded . \\n he kissed me again , on my cheek , and gazed at my face , his expression bright and delighted with whatever he saw in mine . \\n it occurred to me that he had n't shared this place , this experience , with anyone else . \\n just me . \\n `` i love it , '' i said finally , in a voice so low i 'm not even sure he could hear it . \\n but of course he could . \\n he could hear everything i could . \\n i was n't sure if i was ready to admit how not normal i was . \\n sam released all of me but my hand , and tugged me deeper into the shop . \\n `` come on . \\n now the hard part . \\n pick something . \\n what do you want ? \\n pick something . \\n anything . \\n i 'll get it for you . '' \\n i want you . \\n feeling the grip of his hand in mine , the brush of his skin on mine , seeing the way he moved in front of me , equal parts human and wolf , and remembering his smell-i ached with wanting to kiss him . \\n sam 's hand squeezed on mine as if he was reading my thoughts , and he led me to the candy counter . \\n i stared at the rows of perfect chocolates , petit fours , coated pretzels , and truffles . \\n `` cold out tonight , is n't it ? '' \\n the girl behind the counter asked . \\n `` it 's supposed to snow . \\n i ca n't wait . '' \\n she looked up at us and gave us a silly , indulgent smile , and i wondered just how stupidly happy we looked , holding hands and drooling over chocolates . \\n `` what 's the best ? '' \\n i asked . \\n the girl immediately pointed out a few racks of chocolates . \\n sam shook his head . \\n `` could we get two hot chocolates ? '' \\n `` whipped cream ? '' \\n `` do you have to ask ? '' \\n she grinned at us and turned around to prepare it . \\n a whuff of rich chocolate gusted over the counter when she opened the tin of cocoa . \\n while she dribbled peppermint extract into the bottom of paper cups , i turned to sam and took his other hand . \\n i stood on my toes and stole a soft kiss from his lips . \\n `` surprise attack , '' i said . \\n sam leaned down and kissed me back , his mouth lingering on mine , teeth grazing my lower lip , making me shiver . \\n `` surprise attack back . '' \\n `` sneaky , '' i said , my voice breathier than i intended . \\n `` you two are too cute , '' the counter girl said , setting two cups piled with whipped cream on the counter . \\n she had a sort of lopsided , open smile that made me think she laughed a lot . \\n `` seriously . \\n how long have you been going out ? '' \\n sam let go of my hands to get his wallet and took out some bills . \\n `` six years . '' \\n i wrinkled my nose to cover a laugh . \\n of course he would count the time that we 'd been two entirely different species . \\n `` whoa . '' \\n counter girl nodded appreciatively . \\n `` that 's pretty amazing for a couple your age . '' \\n sam handed me my hot chocolate and did n't answer . \\n but his yellow eyes gazed at me possessively-i wondered if he realized that the way he looked at me was far more intimate than copping a feel could ever be . \\n i crouched to look at the almond bark on the bottom shelf in the counter . \\n i was n't quite bold enough to look at either of them when i admitted , `` well , it was love at first sight . '' \\n the girl sighed . \\n `` that is just so romantic . \\n do me a favor , and do n't you two ever change . \\n the world needs more love at first sight . '' \\n sam 's voice was husky . \\n `` do you want some of those , grace ? '' \\n something in his voice , a catch , made me realize that my words had more of an effect than i 'd intended . \\n i wondered when the last time someone had told him they loved him was . \\n that was a really sad thing to think about . \\n i stood up and took sam 's hand again ; his fingers gripped mine so hard it almost hurt . \\n i said , `` those buttercreams look fantastic , actually . \\n can we get some of those ? '' \\n sam nodded at the girl behind the counter . \\n a few minutes later , i was clutching a small paper bag of sweets and sam had whipped cream on the end of his nose . \\n i pointed it out and he grimaced , embarrassed , wiping it off with his sleeve . \\n `` i 'm going to go start the car , '' i said , handing him the bag . \\n he looked at me without saying anything , so i added , `` to warm it up . '' \\n `` oh . \\n right . \\n good thinking . '' \\n i think he 'd forgotten how cold it was outside . \\n i had n't , though , and i had a horrible picture in my head of him spasming in the car while i tried to get the heat higher . \\n i left him in the store and headed out into the dark winter night . \\n it was weird how as soon as the door closed behind me , i felt utterly alone , suddenly assaulted with the vastness of the night , lost without sam 's touch and scent to anchor me . \\n nothing here was familiar to me . \\n if sam became a wolf right now , i did n't know how long it would take me to find my way home or what i 'd do with him-i would n't be able to just leave him here , miles of interstate away from his woods . \\n i 'd lose him in both his forms . \\n the street was already dusted with white , and more snowflakes drifted down around me , delicate and ominous . \\n as i unlocked the car door , my breath made ghostly shapes in front of me . \\n this increasing unease was unusual for me . \\n i shivered and waited in the bronco until it was warmed up , sipping my hot chocolate . \\n sam was right-the hot chocolate was amazing , and immediately i felt better . \\n the little bit of mint shot my mouth through with cold at the same time that the chocolate filled it with warmth . \\n it was soothing , too , and by the time the car was warm , i felt silly for imagining anything would go wrong tonight . \\n i jumped out of the bronco and stuck my head in the candy shop , finding sam where he lingered by the door . \\n `` it 's ready . '' \\n sam shuddered visibly when he felt the blast of cold air come in the door , and without a word , he bolted for the bronco . \\n i called a thanks to the counter girl before following sam , but on the way to the car , i saw something on the sidewalk that made me pause . \\n beneath the scuffed footsteps sam had made were another , older set that i had n't noticed before , pacing back and forth through the new snow in front of the candy shop . \\n my eyes followed their path as they crossed back and forth by the shop , steps long and light , and then i let my gaze follow them down the sidewalk . \\n there was a dark pile about fifteen feet away , out of the bright circle of light of the streetlamp . \\n i hesitated , thinking , just get in the bronco , but then instinct pricked me , and i went to it . \\n it was a dark jacket , a pair of jeans , and a turtleneck , and leading away from the clothing was a trail of pawprints through the light dusting of snow . \\n chapter forty-four sam 32of it sounds stupid , but one of the things that i loved about grace was how she did n't have to talk . \\n sometimes , i just wanted my silences to stay silent , full of thoughts , empty of words . \\n where another girl might have tried to lure me into conversation , grace just reached for my hand , resting our knotted hands on my leg , and leaned her head against my shoulder until we were well out of duluth . \\n she did n't ask how i knew my way around the city , or why my eyes lingered on the road that my parents used to turn down to get to our neighborhood , or how it was that a kid from duluth ended up living in a wolf pack near the canadian border . \\n and when she did finally speak , taking her hand off mine to retrieve a buttercream from the candy shop bag , she told me about how , as a kid , she 'd once made cookies with leftover boiled easter eggs instead of raw ones . \\n it was exactly what i wanted-beautiful distraction . \\n until i heard the musical tone of a cell phone , a descending collection of digital notes , coming from my pocket . \\n for a second i could n't think why a phone would be in my coat , and then i remembered beck stuffing it into my hand while i stared past him . \\n call me when you need me was what he had said . \\n funny how he had said when , not if . \\n `` is that a phone ? '' \\n grace 's eyebrows drew down over her eyes . \\n `` you have a phone ? '' \\n beautiful distraction crashed around me as i dug it out of my pocket . \\n `` i did n't , '' i said weakly . \\n she kept looking at me , and the little bit of hurt in her eyes killed me . \\n shame colored my cheeks . \\n `` i just got one , '' i said . \\n the phone rang again , and i hit the answer button . \\n i did n't have to look at the screen to know who was calling . \\n `` where are you , sam ? \\n it 's cold . '' \\n beck 's voice was full of the genuine concern that i 'd always appreciated . \\n i was aware of grace 's eyes on me . \\n i did n't want his concern . \\n `` i 'm fine . '' \\n beck paused , and i imagined him dissecting the tone of my voice . \\n `` sam , it 's not so black-and-white . \\n try to understand . \\n you wo n't even give me a chance to talk to you . \\n when have i ever been wrong ? '' \\n `` now , '' i said , and hung up . \\n i shoved the phone back in my pocket , half expecting it to ring again . \\n i sort of hoped it would so that i could not answer . \\n grace did n't ask me who it was . \\n she did n't ask me to tell her what was said . \\n i knew she was waiting for me to volunteer the information , and i knew i should , but i did n't want to . \\n i just-i just could n't bear the idea of her seeing beck in that light . \\n or maybe i just could n't bear the idea of me seeing him in that light . \\n i did n't say anything . \\n grace swallowed before pulling out her own phone . \\n `` that reminds me , i should check for messages . \\n ha . \\n as if my family would call . '' \\n she studied her cell phone ; its blue screen lit up the palm of her hand and cast a ghostly light on her chin . \\n `` did they ? '' \\n i asked . \\n `` of course not . \\n they 're rubbing elbows with old friends . '' \\n she punched in their number and waited . \\n i heard a murmur on the other end of the phone , too quiet for me to make out . \\n `` hi , it 's me . \\n yeah . \\n i 'm fine . \\n oh . \\n okay . \\n i wo n't wait up then . \\n have fun . \\n bye . '' \\n she slapped the phone shut , rolled her brown eyes toward me , and smiled wanly . \\n `` let 's elope . '' \\n `` we 'd have to drive to vegas , '' i said . \\n `` no one around here to marry us at this hour except deer and a few drunk guys . '' \\n `` it would have to be the deer , '' grace said firmly . \\n `` the drunk guys would slur our names and that would ruin the moment . '' \\n `` somehow , having a deer preside over the ceremony of a werewolf and a girl seems oddly appropriate , anyway . '' \\n grace laughed . \\n `` and it would get my parents ' attention . \\n ` mom , dad , i 've gotten married . \\n do n't look at me like that . \\n he only sheds part of the year . ' '' \\n i shook my head . \\n i felt like telling her thanks , but instead , i said , `` it was beck on the phone . '' \\n `` the beck ? '' \\n `` yeah . \\n he was in canada with salem-one of the wolves who 's gone completely crazy . '' \\n it was only part of the truth , but at least it was the truth . \\n `` i want to meet him , '' grace said immediately . \\n my face must 've gone funny , because she said , `` beck , i mean . \\n he 's practically your dad , is n't he ? '' \\n i rubbed my fingers over the steering wheel , eyes glancing from the road to my knuckles pressed into a white grip . \\n strange how some people took their skin for granted , never thought of what it would be like to lose it . \\n sloughing my skin / escaping its grip / stripped of my wit / it hurts to be me . \\n i thought of the most fatherly memory i had of beck . \\n `` we had this big grill at his house , and i remember , one night , he was tired of doing the cooking and he said , ` sam , tonight you 're feeding us . ' \\n he showed me how to push on the middle of the steaks to see how done they were , and how to sear them fast on each side to keep the juices in . '' \\n `` and they were awesome , were n't they ? '' \\n `` i burned the hell out of them , '' i said , matter-of-fact . \\n `` i 'd compare them to charcoal , but charcoal is still sort of edible . '' \\n grace started to laugh . \\n `` beck ate his , '' i said , smiling ruefully at the memory . \\n `` he said it was the best steak he 'd ever had , because he had n't had to make it . '' \\n that felt like a long time ago . \\n grace was smiling at me , like old stories about me and my pack leader were the greatest thing in the world . \\n like it was inspirational . \\n like we had something , beck and me , father and son . \\n in my head , the kid in the back of the tahoe looked at me and said , `` help . '' \\n grace asked , `` how long has it been ? \\n i mean-not since the steaks . \\n since you were bitten . '' \\n `` i was seven . \\n eleven years ago . '' \\n she asked , `` why were you in the woods ? \\n i mean , you 're from duluth , are n't you ? \\n or at least that 's what it said on your driver 's license . '' \\n `` i was n't attacked in the woods , '' i said . \\n `` it was all over the papers . '' \\n grace 's eyes held me ; i looked away to the dim road in front of us . \\n `` two wolves attacked me while i was getting onto the school bus . \\n one of them held me down , and the other one bit me . '' \\n ripped at me , really , as if its only goal had been to draw blood . \\n but of course , that had been the goal , had n't it ? \\n looking back , it all seemed painfully clear . \\n i 'd never thought to look beyond my simple childhood memory of being attacked by wolves , and beck stepping in as my savior after my parents had tried to kill me . \\n i had been so close to beck , and beck had been so above reproach , that i had n't wanted to look any deeper . \\n but now , retelling the story to grace shoved the unavoidable truth right at me : my attack had been no accident . \\n i 'd been chosen , hunted down , and dragged into the street to be infected , just like those kids in the back of the tahoe . \\n later beck had arrived to pick up the pieces . \\n you 're the best of them , beck 's voice said in my head . \\n he had thought i 'd outlive him and take over the pack . \\n i should 've been angry . \\n furious at having my life ripped away from me . \\n but there was just white noise inside me , a dull hum of nothingness . \\n `` in the city ? '' \\n grace asked . \\n `` the suburbs . \\n there were n't any woods around . \\n neighbors said they saw the wolves running through their backyards to escape afterward . '' \\n grace did n't say anything . \\n the fact that i 'd been deliberately hunted felt obvious to me , and i kept waiting for her to say it . \\n i kind of wanted her to say it , to point out the unfairness . \\n but she did n't . \\n i just felt her frowning at me , thinking . \\n `` which wolves ? '' \\n grace asked finally . \\n `` i do n't remember . \\n one of them might 've been paul , because one of them was black . \\n that 's all i know . '' \\n there was silence for several long moments , and then we were home . \\n the driveway of the house still stood empty , and grace blew out a long breath . \\n `` looks like we 're on our own again , '' she said . \\n `` stay here until i get the door unlocked , okay ? '' \\n grace jumped out of the car , letting in a blast of cold air that bit my cheeks ; i turned the heater up as high as it would go to prepare myself for the journey inside . \\n leaning on the vents , feeling the heat sting my skin , i squeezed my eyes shut , trying to will myself back into the distraction i had felt earlier . \\n back when i was holding grace against me in the candy shop , feeling her warm body searing against mine , watching her smell the air , knowing she was smelling me-i shivered . \\n i did n't know if i could stand another night with her , behaving myself . \\n `` sam ! '' \\n called grace from outside . \\n i opened my eyes , focusing on her head poking out of the cracked front door . \\n she was trying to keep the entryway as warm as possible for me . \\n clever . \\n time to run . \\n shutting off the bronco , i leaped out and bolted up the slick sidewalk , feet slipping a bit on the ice , my skin prickling and twisting . \\n grace slammed the door shut behind me , locking the cold outside , and threw her arms around me , lending her heat to my body . \\n her voice was a breathless whisper near my ear . \\n `` are you warm enough ? '' \\n my eyes , starting to adjust to the darkness in the hall , caught the glimmer of light in her eyes , the outline of her hair , the curve of her arms around me . \\n a mirror on the wall offered a similarly dim portrait of the shape of her body against mine . \\n i let her hold me for a long moment before i said , `` i 'm okay . '' \\n `` do you want anything to eat ? '' \\n her voice sounded loud in the empty house , echoing off the wood floor . \\n the only other sound was the air through the heating vents , a steady , low breath . \\n i was acutely aware that we were alone . \\n i swallowed . \\n `` i want to go to bed . '' \\n she sounded relieved . \\n `` i do , too . '' \\n i almost regretted that she agreed with me , because maybe if i 'd stayed up , eaten a sandwich , watched tv , something , i could 've distracted myself from how badly i wanted her . \\n but she had n't disagreed . \\n kicking off her shoes behind the door , she padded down the hallway in front of me . \\n we slipped into her dark bedroom , no light but the moon reflecting off the thin layer of snow outside the window . \\n the door closed with a soft sigh and snick and she leaned on it , her hands still on the doorknob behind her . \\n a long moment passed before she said anything . \\n `` why are you so careful with me , sam roth ? '' \\n i tried to tell her the truth . \\n `` i-it 's - i 'm not an animal . '' \\n `` i 'm not afraid of you , '' she said . \\n she did n't look afraid of me . \\n she looked beautiful , moonlit , tempting , smelling of peppermint and soap and skin . \\n i 'd spent eleven years watching the rest of the pack become animals , pushing down my instincts , controlling myself , fighting to stay human , fighting to do the right thing . \\n as if reading my thoughts , she said , `` can you tell me it 's only the wolf in you that wants to kiss me ? '' \\n all of me wanted to kiss her hard enough to make me disappear . \\n i braced my arms on either side of her head , the door giving out a creak as i leaned against it , and i pressed my mouth against hers . \\n she kissed me back , lips hot , tongue flicking against my teeth , hands still behind her , body still pressed against the door . \\n everything in me buzzed , electric , wanting to close the few inches of space between us . \\n she kissed me harder , breath huffing into my mouth , and bit my lower lip . \\n oh , hell , that was amazing . \\n i growled before i could stop myself , but before i could even think to feel embarrassed , grace had pulled her hands out from behind her and looped them around my neck , pulling me to her . \\n `` that was so sexy , '' she said , voice uneven . \\n `` i did n't think you could get any sexier . '' \\n i kissed her again before she could say anything else , backing into the room with her , a tangle of arms in the moonlight . \\n her fingers hooked into the back of my jeans , thumbs brushing my hip bones , pulling me even closer to her . \\n `` oh , god , grace , '' i gasped . \\n `` you-you greatly overestimate my self-control . '' \\n `` i 'm not looking for self-control . '' \\n my hands were inside her shirt , palms pressed on her back , fingers spread on her sides ; i did n't even remember how they got there . \\n `` i-i do n't want to do anything you 'll regret . '' \\n grace 's back curved against my fingers as if my touch brought her to life . \\n `` then do n't stop . '' \\n i 'd imagined her saying this in so many different ways , but none of my fantasies had come close to the breathless reality . \\n clumsily , we backed onto her bed , part of me thinking we should be quiet in case her parents came home . \\n but she helped me tug my shirt over my head and ran a hand down my chest , and i groaned , forgetting everything but her fingers on my skin . \\n my mind searched for lyrics , words to string together to describe the moment , but nothing came . \\n i could n't think of anything but her palm grazing my skin . \\n `` you smell so good , '' grace whispered . \\n `` every time i touch you , it comes off you even stronger . '' \\n her nostrils flared , all wolf , smelling how much i wanted her . \\n knowing what i was , and wanting me , anyway . \\n she let me push her gently down onto the pillows and i braced my arms on either side of her , straddling her in my jeans . \\n `` are you sure ? '' \\n i asked . \\n her eyes were bright , excited . \\n she nodded . \\n i slid down to kiss her belly ; it felt so right , so natural , like i 'd done it a thousand times before and would do it a thousand times again . \\n i saw the shiny , ugly scars the pack had left on her neck and collarbone , and i kissed them , too . \\n grace pulled the blankets up over us and we kicked off our clothes beneath them . \\n as we pressed our bodies against each other , i shrugged off my skin with a growl , giving in , neither wolf nor man , just sam . \\n chapter forty-five grace 30of the phone was ringing . \\n that was the first thing i thought . \\n the second thing i thought was that sam 's bare arm was lying across my chest . \\n the third thing was that my face was cold where it was sticking out from under the blankets . \\n i blinked , trying to wake up , strangely disoriented in my own room . \\n it took me a moment to realize that my alarm clock 's normally glowing face was dark and that the only lights in the room were coming from the moon outside the window and the face of the ringing cell phone . \\n i snaked a hand out into the air to retrieve it , careful not to disturb sam 's arm on me ; the phone was silent by the time i got to it . \\n god , it was freezing in here . \\n the power must 've gone down with the ice storm the forecasters had promised . \\n i wondered how long it would be down and if i 'd have to worry about sam getting too cold . \\n i carefully peeled back the covers and found him curled against me , head buried against my side , only the pale , na ** d curve of his shoulders visible in the dim light . \\n i kept waiting for this to feel wrong , his body pressed up against mine , but i just felt so alive that my heart hammered with the thrill of it . \\n this , sam and me , this was my real life . \\n the life where i went to school and waited up for my parents and listened to rachel vent about her siblings-that felt like a pale dream in comparison . \\n those were just things i had done while waiting for sam . \\n outside , distant and mournful , wolves began to howl , and a few seconds later , the phone rang again , notes stepping down the scale , a strange , digital echo of the wolves . \\n i did n't realize my mistake until i held it to my ear . \\n `` sam . '' \\n the voice at the other end was unfamiliar . \\n stupid me . \\n i had taken sam 's phone from the nightstand , not mine . \\n i debated for two seconds how to respond . \\n i contemplated snapping the phone shut , but i could n't do that . \\n `` no , '' i replied . \\n `` not sam . '' \\n the voice was pleasant , but i heard an edge beneath his words . \\n `` i 'm sorry . \\n i must 've dialed wrong . '' \\n `` no , '' i said , before he could hang up . \\n `` this is sam 's phone . '' \\n there was a long , heavy pause , and then : `` oh . '' \\n another pause . \\n `` you 're the girl , are n't you ? \\n the girl who was in my house ? '' \\n i tried to think of what i might gain by denying it and drew a blank . \\n `` yes . '' \\n `` do you have a name ? '' \\n `` do you ? '' \\n he gave a short laugh that was completely without humor but not unpleasant . \\n `` i think i like you . \\n i 'm beck . '' \\n `` that makes sense . '' \\n i turned my face away from sam , who was still breathing heavily , my voice muffled by his arms over his head . \\n `` what did you do to piss him off ? '' \\n again the short laugh . \\n `` he 's still angry with me ? '' \\n i considered how to answer . \\n `` not now . \\n he 's sleeping . \\n can i give him a message ? '' \\n i stared at beck 's number on the phone , trying to remember it . \\n there was another long pause , so long that i thought beck had hung up , and then he breathed out audibly . \\n `` one of his ... friends has been hurt . \\n do you think you could wake him ? '' \\n one of the other wolves . \\n it had to be . \\n i ducked down into the covers . \\n `` oh-of course . \\n of course i will . '' \\n i put the phone down and gently moved sam 's arm so that i could see his ear and the side of his face . \\n `` sam , wake up . \\n phone . \\n it 's important . '' \\n he turned his head so that i could see that his yellow eye was already open . \\n `` put it on speaker . '' \\n i did , resting it on my belly so that the camera 's face lit a small blue circle on my tank top . \\n `` what 's going on ? '' \\n sam slid up onto one elbow , made a face when he felt the cold , and jerked the blankets up around us , making a tent around the phone . \\n `` someone attacked paul . \\n he 's a mess , ripped to shreds . '' \\n sam 's mouth made a little o. i do n't think he was thinking about what his face looked like-his eyes were far away , with his pack . \\n finally , he said , `` could you-have you-is he still bleeding ? \\n was he human ? '' \\n `` human . \\n i tried to ask him who did it-so i could kill them . \\n i thought ... sam , i really thought i was going to be calling you to tell you he died . \\n it was that bad . \\n but i think it 's closing up now . \\n but the thing is , it was all these little bites , all over , on his neck and on his wrists and his belly , it was as if - '' '' - as if someone knew how to kill him , '' sam finished . \\n `` it was a wolf who did it , '' beck said . \\n `` we got that much out of him . '' \\n `` one of your new ones ? '' \\n sam snarled , with surprising force . \\n `` sam . '' \\n `` could it have been ? '' \\n `` sam . \\n no . \\n they 're inside . '' \\n sam 's body was still tense beside me , and i mulled over possible meanings for that phrase : one of your new ones . \\n was jack not the only new one ? \\n `` will you come ? '' \\n beck asked . \\n `` can you ? \\n is it too cold ? '' \\n `` i do n't know . '' \\n i knew from the twist of sam 's mouth that he was only answering the first question . \\n whatever it was that had distanced him from beck , it was powerful . \\n beck 's voice changed , softer , younger , more vulnerable . \\n `` please do n't be angry with me still , sam . \\n i ca n't stand it . '' \\n sam turned his face away from the phone . \\n `` sam , '' beck said softly . \\n i felt sam shudder next to me , and he closed his eyes . \\n `` are you still there ? '' \\n i looked at sam , but he still did n't speak . \\n i could n't help it-i felt sorry for beck . \\n `` i am , '' i said . \\n there was a long pause , completely devoid of static or crackling , and i thought beck had hung up . \\n but then he asked , in a careful way , `` how much do you know about sam , girl-without-a-name ? '' \\n `` everything . '' \\n pause . \\n then : `` i 'd like to meet you . '' \\n sam reached out and snapped the phone shut . \\n the light of the display vanished , leaving us in the dark beneath the covers . \\n chapter forty-six grace 45of my parents did n't even know . \\n the morning after sam and i-spent the night together , it seemed like the biggest thing on my mind was that my parents had no idea . \\n i guessed that was normal . \\n i guessed feeling a little guilty was normal . \\n i guessed feeling giddy was normal . \\n it was as if i had thought all along i was a complete picture , and sam had revealed that i was a puzzle , and had taken me apart into pieces and put me back together again . \\n i was acutely aware of each distinct emotion , all fitting together tightly . \\n sam was quiet , too , letting me drive , holding my right hand in both of his while i drove with the other . \\n i would 've given a million dollars to know what he was thinking . \\n `` what do you want to do this afternoon ? '' \\n i asked , finally . \\n he looked out the window , fingers rubbing the back of my hand . \\n the world outside looked dry , papery . \\n waiting for snow . \\n `` anything with you . '' \\n `` anything ? '' \\n he looked over at me and grinned . \\n it was a funny , lopsided grin . \\n i think maybe he was feeling as giddy as i was . \\n `` yes , anything , as long as you 're there . '' \\n `` i want to meet beck , '' i said . \\n there . \\n it was out . \\n it had been one of the puzzle pieces stuck in my head ever since i 'd picked up the phone . \\n sam did n't say anything . \\n his eyes were on the school , probably figuring that if he waited just a few minutes , he could deposit me on the sidewalk and avoid discussion . \\n but instead he sighed as if he was incredibly tired . \\n `` god , grace . \\n why ? '' \\n `` he 's practically your father , sam . \\n i want to know everything about you . \\n it ca n't be that hard to understand . '' \\n `` you just want everything in its place . '' \\n sam 's eyes followed the knots of students slowly making their way across the parking lot . \\n i avoided finding a parking place . \\n `` you just want to perform magical matchmaking on me and him , so that you can feel like everything 's in its place again . '' \\n `` if you 're trying to irritate me by saying that , you wo n't . \\n i already know it 's true . '' \\n sam was silent while i circled the lot another time , and finally , he groaned . \\n `` grace , i hate this . \\n i hate confrontation . '' \\n `` there wo n't be confrontation . \\n he wants to see you . '' \\n `` you do n't know everything that 's going on . \\n there 's awful stuff going on . \\n there 'll be confrontation , if i have any principles left . \\n hard to imagine after last night . '' \\n i found a parking place in a hurry , one on the farthest end of the lot so that i could face him without curious eyes watching us on the way to the sidewalk . \\n `` are you feeling guilty ? '' \\n `` no . \\n maybe . \\n a little . \\n i feel ... uneasy . '' \\n `` we used protection , '' i said . \\n sam did n't look at me . \\n `` not that . \\n i just-i just-i just hope it was the right time . '' \\n `` it was the right time . '' \\n he looked away . \\n `` only thing i wonder , is ... did you have s-make love-to me to get back at your parents ? '' \\n i just stared at him . \\n then i grabbed my backpack from the backseat . \\n i was suddenly furious , ears and cheeks hot , and i did n't know why . \\n i did n't recognize my voice when i answered . \\n `` that 's a nice thing to say . '' \\n sam did n't look back at me . \\n it was like the side of the school was fascinating to him . \\n so fascinating he could n't look me in the eyes while he accused me of using him . \\n a new wave of anger washed over me . \\n `` do you have such crap self-esteem that you think i would n't want you just for you ? '' \\n i pushed open the door and slid out ; sam winced at the air that came in , though it could n't have been cold enough to hurt him . \\n `` way to ruin it . \\n just-way to ruin it . '' \\n i started to slam the door , but he reached far across the seat to keep the door from shutting all the way . \\n `` wait . \\n grace , wait . '' \\n `` what ? '' \\n `` i do n't want to let you go like this . '' \\n his eyes were pleading with me , their absolute saddest . \\n i looked at the goose bumps raising on his arms , and the slight tremble of his shoulders in the cold draft . \\n and he had me . \\n no matter how angry i was , we both knew what could happen while i was in school . \\n i hated that . \\n the fear . \\n i hated it . \\n `` i 'm sorry i said it , '' sam blurted out , rushing to get out words before i left . \\n `` you 're right . \\n i just could n't believe something-someone-so good could happen to me . \\n do n't go mad , grace . \\n please do n't go mad . '' \\n i closed my eyes . \\n for a brief moment i wished with all my heart that he was just a normal boy , so that i could storm away with my pride and indignation . \\n but he was n't . \\n he was as fragile as a butterfly in autumn , waiting to be destroyed by the first frost . \\n so i swallowed my anger , a bitter mouthful , and opened the door a bit more . \\n `` i do n't want you to ever think something like that again , sam roth . '' \\n he closed his eyes just a little bit when i said his name , lashes hiding his yellow irises for a second , and then he reached out and touched my cheek . \\n `` i 'm sorry . '' \\n i caught his hand and tangled his fingers in mine , fixing my gaze on his face . \\n `` how do you think beck would feel if you went away mad ? '' \\n sam laughed , a humorless , self-deprecating laugh that reminded me of beck 's on the phone the night before , and dropped his eyes from mine . \\n he knew i had his number . \\n he pulled his fingers away . \\n `` we 'll go . \\n fine , we 'll go . '' \\n i was about to leave , but i stopped . \\n `` why are you angry at beck , sam ? \\n why are you so mad at him when i 've never seen you angry at your real parents ? '' \\n sam 's face told me he had n't asked himself this question before , and it took him a long time to answer . \\n `` because beck-beck did n't have to do what he did . \\n my parents did . \\n they thought i was a monster . \\n they were afraid . \\n it was n't calculated . '' \\n his face was full of pain and uncertainty . \\n i stepped up into the car and kissed him gently . \\n i did n't know what to say to him , so i just kissed him again , got my backpack , and went into the gray day . \\n when i looked back over my shoulder , he was still sitting there , gaze silent and lupine . \\n the last thing i saw was his eyes half-closed against the breeze , black hair tousled , reminding me for some reason of the first night i 'd ever seen him . \\n an unexpected breeze lifted my hair from my neck , frigid and penetrating . \\n winter suddenly felt very close . \\n i stopped on the sidewalk , closing my eyes , fighting the incredible desire to go back to sam . \\n in the end , duty won out , and i headed into the school . \\n but it felt like a mistake . \\n chapter forty-seven sam 44of after grace got out of the car , i felt sick . \\n sick from arguing with her , sick from doubt , sick from the cold that was just warm enough to keep me human . \\n more than sick-restless , unsettled . \\n too many loose ends : jack , isabel , olivia , shelby , beck . \\n i could n't believe that grace and i were going to see beck . \\n i turned up the heat in the bronco and rested my head on the steering wheel for several long moments , until the ridged vinyl started to hurt my forehead . \\n with the heat turned up all the way , it did n't take too long for the car to become stuffy and hot , but it felt good . \\n it felt far away from changing . \\n like i was firmly in my own skin . \\n i thought at first that i might just sit like that all day , singing a song under my breath-close to the sun is closer to me / i feel my skin clinging so tightly-and waiting for grace , but it only took me a half hour of sitting to decide that i needed to drive . \\n more than that , i needed to atone for what i 'd said to grace . \\n so i decided to go to jack 's house again . \\n he still had n't turned up , either dead or in the newspapers , and it was the only place i could think of starting the search again . \\n grace would be happy to see me trying to put everything into place for her . \\n i left the bronco on an isolated logging road near the culpepers ' house and cut through the woods . \\n the pines were colorless with the promise of snow , their tips waving slightly in a cold wind that i could n't feel down below the branches . \\n the hair on the back of my neck tingled uncomfortably ; the stark pine woods reeked of wolf . \\n it smelled like the kid had peed on every tree . \\n cocky bastard . \\n movement to my right made me jump , tense , drop low to the ground . \\n i held in a breath . \\n just a deer . \\n i caught a brief glimpse of wide eyes , long legs , white tail , before she was gone , surprisingly ungraceful in the underbrush . \\n her presence in the woods was comforting , though ; her being here meant that jack was n't . \\n i had nothing as a weapon except my hands . \\n fat lot of good they would do against an unstable new wolf with adrenaline on his side . \\n near the house , i froze at the edge of the woods , listening to the voices carrying through the trees . \\n a girl and a boy , voices raised and angry , standing somewhere near the back door . \\n creeping into the shadow of the mansion , i slid around a corner toward them , silent as a wolf . \\n i did n't recognize the male voice , fierce and deep , but instinct told me that it was jack . \\n the other one was isabel . \\n i thought about revealing myself but hesitated , waiting to hear what the argument was about . \\n isabel 's voice was high . \\n `` i do n't understand what you 're saying . \\n what are you saying sorry for ? \\n for disappearing ? \\n for getting bitten in the first place ? \\n for - '' `` for chloe , '' the boy said . \\n there was a pause . \\n `` what do you mean , ` for chloe ' ? \\n what does the dog have to do with all this ? \\n do you know where she is ? '' \\n `` isabel . \\n hell . \\n have n't you been listening ? \\n you 're so stupid sometimes . \\n i told you , i do n't know what i 'm doing after i 've changed . '' \\n i covered my mouth to keep from laughing . \\n jack had eaten her dog . \\n `` are you saying that she 's - you-god ! \\n you 're such a jerk ! '' \\n `` i could n't help it . \\n i told you what i was . \\n you should n't have let her out . '' \\n `` do you have any idea how much that dog cost ? '' \\n `` boo hoo . '' \\n `` so what am i supposed to tell the parental units ? \\n mom , dad , jack 's a werewolf , and guess what , you know how chloe 's been missing ? \\n he ate her . '' \\n `` do n't tell them anything ! '' \\n jack said hurriedly . \\n `` anyway , i think i 've stopped it . \\n i think i 've found a cure . '' \\n i frowned . \\n `` cure . '' \\n isabel 's voice was flat . \\n `` how do you ` fix ' being a werewolf ? '' \\n `` do n't you worry your blonde brain about it . \\n i just-give me a few more days to make sure . \\n when i 'm sure , i 'll tell them everything . '' \\n `` fine . \\n whatever . \\n god-i ca n't believe you ate chloe . '' \\n `` can you please shut up about that ? \\n you 're starting to irritate me . '' \\n `` whatever . \\n what about the other ones ? \\n are n't there other ones ? \\n ca n't you get them to help you ? '' \\n `` isabel , shut up . \\n i told you , i think i 've figured it out . \\n i do n't need any help . '' \\n `` do n't you just think - '' a noise , sharp and out of place . \\n a branch snapping ? \\n a slap ? \\n isabel 's voice sounded different when she spoke again . \\n not as strong . \\n `` just do n't let them see you , okay ? \\n mom 's at therapy-because of you-and dad 's out of town . \\n i 'm going back to school . \\n i ca n't believe you called me out here to tell me you ate my dog . '' \\n `` i called you to tell you i fixed it . \\n you seem so excited . \\n yeah . \\n not . '' \\n `` it 's great . \\n wonderful . \\n bye . '' \\n barely a moment later , i heard isabel 's suv tear down the driveway , and i hesitated again . \\n i was n't exactly eager to reveal myself to a new wolf with an anger management problem until i knew exactly what my surroundings were , but i needed to either get back to the car or into the warmth of the house . \\n and the house was closer . \\n i slowly crept around the back of the building , listening for jack 's position . \\n nothing . \\n he must 've gone inside . \\n i approached the door i had broken into earlier that week-the window had already been fixed-and tried the knob . \\n unlocked . \\n how thoughtful . \\n inside , i immediately heard jack rummaging around , loud in the otherwise still house , and i slunk down the dim hallway to a long , high-ceilinged kitchen , all black-and-white tile and black countertops as far as the eye could see . \\n the light through the two windows on the right wall was white and pure , reflecting off white walls and sinking into the black skillets hanging from the ceiling . \\n it was as if the entire room were in black and white . \\n i vastly preferred grace 's kitchen-warm , cluttered , smelling of cinnamon and garlic and bread-to this cavernous , sterile room . \\n jack had his back to me as he crouched in front of the stainless steel fridge , digging through the drawers . \\n i froze , but his hunt through the fridge had covered up the sound of my approach . \\n there was no wind to carry my scent to him , so i stood for a long minute , assessing him and my options . \\n he was tall , wide-shouldered , with curly black hair , like a greek statue . \\n something about the way he carried himself suggested overconfidence , and for some reason , that irritated me . \\n i swallowed a growl and slid just inside the door , silently lifting myself onto the counter opposite . \\n height would give me a slight advantage , if jack got aggressive . \\n he stepped away from the fridge and dumped an armload of food onto the shiny topped kitchen island . \\n for several long minutes , i watched him construct a sandwich . \\n he carefully layered the meats and the cheeses , slathered the bread with miracle whip , and then he looked up . \\n `` jesus , '' he said . \\n `` hi , '' i replied . \\n `` what do you want ? '' \\n he did n't look afraid ; i was n't big enough to frighten by looks alone . \\n i did n't know how to answer him . \\n hearing his conversation with isabel had changed what i wanted to know . \\n `` so what is it you think will cure you ? '' \\n now he looked afraid . \\n just for a second , and then it was gone , lost in the self-assured set of his chin . \\n `` what are you talking about ? '' \\n `` you think you 've found a cure . \\n why would you think that ? '' \\n `` okay , dude . \\n who are you ? '' \\n i really did n't like him . \\n i did n't know why ; i just felt it in my gut and i really did n't like him . \\n if i had n't thought he was a danger to grace and olivia and isabel , i would 've said the hell with him and left him there . \\n still , my dislike made it easier to confront him . \\n it made it easier to play the role of the guy who had all the answers . \\n `` someone like you . \\n someone who got bitten . '' \\n he looked about to protest , and i held up my hand to stop him . \\n `` if you 're thinking you 're going to say something like ` you 've got the wrong guy , ' do n't bother . \\n i 've seen you as a wolf . \\n so just tell me why you think you 've found a way to stop it . '' \\n `` why should i trust you ? '' \\n `` because , unlike your father , i do n't stuff animals and put them in my foyer . \\n and because i do n't really want you showing up at the school and on people 's doorsteps and exposing the pack . \\n we 're just trying to survive with the crappy lot we 've been given . \\n we do n't need some smarmy rich punk like you revealing us to the rest of the world , so they can come after us with pitchforks . '' \\n jack growled . \\n it was a little too close to animal for my taste , and my thought was confirmed when i saw him shiver slightly . \\n he was still so unstable-he could change at any time . \\n `` i do n't have to worry about it anymore . \\n i 'm getting a cure , so you can get the hell away from here and leave me alone . '' \\n he backed away from the island , toward the counter behind him . \\n i jumped down from my counter . \\n `` jack , there is no cure . '' \\n `` you 're wrong , '' he snapped . \\n `` there 's another wolf that was cured . '' \\n he was edging toward the knife block . \\n i should 've run for the door , but his words froze me . \\n `` what ? '' \\n `` yeah , it took me all this time , but i figured it out . \\n there 's a girl who was bitten and got cured , at school . \\n grace . \\n i know she knows the cure . \\n and she 's about to tell me in a hurry . '' \\n my world reeled . \\n `` stay away from her . '' \\n jack grinned at me , or maybe it was a grimace . \\n his hand was on the counter , feeling backward toward the knives , and his nostrils flared , taking in the faint odor of wolf that the cold had brought to my skin . \\n he said , `` why ? \\n do n't you want to know , too ? \\n or has she already cured you ? '' \\n `` there is no cure . \\n she does n't know anything . '' \\n i hated how much my voice revealed ; my feelings for grace felt dangerously transparent . \\n `` you do n't know that , man , '' jack said . \\n he reached for a knife , but his hand was shaking too much to grasp the handle on the first try . \\n `` now get out of here . '' \\n but i did n't move . \\n i could n't think of anything worse than him confronting grace about a cure . \\n him trembling , unstable , violent ; and her , unable to give him the answers he was looking for . \\n jack managed to grab a handle and pulled out a wicked-looking knife , the edge serrated and reflecting the black and white of the kitchen in a dozen different directions . \\n he was shaking so badly that he could barely hold the blade toward me . \\n `` i asked you to get out . '' \\n my instincts urged me to leap on him like i would on one of the wolves , growl over his neck and make him submit . \\n to make him promise to stay away from her . \\n but that was n't how it worked when you were a human , not when your adversary was so much stronger . \\n i approached him , eyes on his eyes instead of on the knife , and tried a different tactic . \\n `` jack . \\n please . \\n she does n't have the answer , but i can make this easier for you . '' \\n `` get away from me . '' \\n jack took a step toward me , then back , before stumbling to one knee . \\n the knife fell onto the tile ; i winced before it landed , but its landing was surprisingly muffled . \\n jack made almost no sound at all when he followed the knife to the floor . \\n his fingers were claws , curling and uncurling on the black-and-white squares . \\n he was saying something , but it was unintelligible . \\n lyrics formed in my head . \\n they were supposed to be for him , but they were really about me . \\n world of words lost on the living / i take my place with the walking dead / robbed of my voice i 'm always giving / thousands of words to this nameless dread . \\n i crouched next to him , pushing the knife away from his body so that he would n't hurt himself on it . \\n there was no point asking him anything now . \\n i sighed and listened to him groan , wail , scream . \\n we were equals now , me and jack . \\n for all his privilege and nice hair and confident shoulders , he was no better than me . \\n jack whimpered . \\n `` you should be happy , '' i told the panting wolf . \\n `` you did n't throw up this time . '' \\n jack regarded me for a long moment with unblinking hazel eyes before leaping up and bolting for the door . \\n i wanted to just leave , but i did n't have any choice . \\n any possibility of leaving him behind had disappeared as soon as he 'd said grace 's name . \\n i jumped after him . \\n we scrambled through the house , his nails slipping on the hardwood floor and my shoes squeaking behind him . \\n i pelted into the hall of grinning animals close behind him ; the stench of their dead skins filled my nostrils . \\n jack had two advantages : he knew the house and he was a wolf . \\n i was betting on him using the well-known surroundings to hide instead of relying on his unfamiliar animal strength . \\n i bet wrong . \\n chapter forty-eight grace 49of sam had never been late before . \\n he had always been waiting in the bronco by the time i got out of class , so i 'd never had to wonder where he might be or what to do while i waited . \\n but today i waited . \\n today i waited until the students loaded onto the buses . \\n i waited until the lingering students headed out to their cars and disappeared in ones and twos . \\n i waited until the teachers emerged from the school and climbed into their cars . \\n i thought about taking my homework out . \\n i thought about the sun creeping down toward the tree line and i wondered how cold it was in the shade . \\n `` your ride late , grace ? '' \\n mr. rink asked kindly , on his way out . \\n he had changed shirts since class and smelled vaguely like cologne . \\n i must 've looked lost , sitting on the brick edge of the little mulched area in front of the school , hugging my backpack in my lap . \\n `` a little . '' \\n `` do you need me to call someone ? '' \\n out of the corner of my eye , i saw the bronco pull into the lot , and i allowed myself a long breath . \\n i smiled at mr. rink . \\n `` nope . \\n they just showed up . '' \\n `` good thing , too , '' he said . \\n `` it 's supposed to get really cold later . \\n snow ! '' \\n `` yippee , '' i said sourly , and he laughed and waved as he walked out to his car . \\n i yanked my backpack onto my shoulder and hurried out to the bronco . \\n pulling open the passenger-side door , i jumped in . \\n it was only a second after i 'd shut the door that i realized that the smell was all wrong . \\n i lifted my eyes to the driver and crossed my arms over my chest , trembling . \\n `` where 's sam ? '' \\n `` you mean the guy who 's supposed to be sitting here , '' jack said . \\n even though i 'd seen his eyes peering out of a wolf 's body , even though i 'd heard isabel say she 'd seen him , even though we 'd known he was alive for weeks , i was n't prepared for seeing jack in the flesh . \\n his curly black hair , longer than when i 'd last seen him in the halls , his darting hazel eyes , his hands clinging to the steering wheel . \\n real . \\n alive . \\n my heart kicked in my chest . \\n jack 's eyes were on the road as he tore out of the parking lot . \\n i imagined he thought i would n't try to get away if the bronco was moving , but he did n't have to worry . \\n i was fixed in place by the unknown : where was sam ? \\n `` yes , i mean the guy who 's supposed to be sitting there . '' \\n my voice came out as a snarl . \\n `` where is he ? '' \\n jack glanced over at me ; he was nervy , shaking . \\n what was the word sam had used to describe new wolves ? \\n unstable ? \\n `` i 'm not trying to be the bad guy here , grace . \\n but i need answers , and soon , or i 'm going to get bad really fast . '' \\n `` you 're driving like an idiot . \\n if you do n't want to get pulled over by the cops , you 'd better slow down . \\n where are we going ? '' \\n `` i do n't know . \\n you tell me . \\n i want to know how to stop this and i want to know now because it 's getting worse . '' \\n i did n't know whether he meant it was getting worse as the weather got colder , or worse right this second . \\n `` i 'm not telling you anything until you take me to wherever sam is . '' \\n jack did n't answer . \\n i said , `` i 'm not playing around . \\n where is he ? '' \\n jack jerked his head toward me . \\n `` i do n't think you get it . \\n i 'm the one driving and i 'm the one who knows where he is and i 'm the one who can rip your head off if i change , so it seems to me you 're the one who ought to start pissing herself and telling me what i want to know . '' \\n his hands were clamped on the steering wheel , bracing arms that were shuddering . \\n god , he was going to change soon . \\n i had to think of something to get him off the road . \\n `` what do you want to know ? '' \\n `` how to stop it . \\n i know you know the cure . \\n i know you were bitten . '' \\n `` jack , i do n't know how to stop it . \\n i ca n't cure you . '' \\n `` yeah , i thought you 'd say that . \\n that 's why i bit your stupid friend . \\n because if you wo n't fight to cure me , i know you 'll do it for her . \\n i just had to make sure she was really going to change . '' \\n the staggering sense of it stole my breath ; i could barely get my voice out . \\n `` you bit olivia ? '' \\n `` are you an idiot ? \\n i just said that . \\n so now you 'd better start talking because i 'm going to ahh . '' \\n jack 's neck jerked , wrenching awkwardly . \\n my wolf senses screamed danger fear terror anger at me , emotions rolling off him in waves . \\n i reached out and spun the heating dial up . \\n i did n't know how much of a difference it would make , but it could n't hurt . \\n `` it 's the cold . \\n the cold changes you to a wolf and the heat stops it . '' \\n i was talking quickly , trying to keep him from getting a word in , trying to keep him from getting any angrier . \\n `` it 's worse when you first get bitten . \\n you change back and forth all the time , but it gets more stable . \\n you get to be human for longer-you 'll get the whole summer - '' jack 's arms spasmed again , and the car fishtailed in the gravel of the shoulder before tracking back onto the road . \\n `` you ca n't be driving right now ! \\n please . \\n i 'm not going to run away or whatever-i want to help you , really i do . \\n but you 've got to take me to sam . '' \\n `` shut up . '' \\n jack 's voice was part growl . \\n `` that bitch said she wanted to help me , too . \\n i 'm done with that . \\n she told me you were bitten and that you did n't change . \\n i followed you . \\n it was cold . \\n you did n't change . \\n so what is it ? \\n olivia said she did n't know . '' \\n my skin was burning from the blasting heater and the force of his emotion . \\n every time he said olivia it was like a punch in the gut . \\n `` she does n't know . \\n i was bitten , she was right . \\n but i never changed , not even once . \\n i do n't have a cure . \\n i just did n't change . \\n i do n't know why , nobody knows why . \\n please - '' `` stop lying to me . '' \\n it was hard to understand him now . \\n `` i want the truth now or you 're going to get hurt . '' \\n i closed my eyes . \\n i felt like i had lost my balance and the whole world was spinning away from me . \\n there had to be something i could say to him that would make this better . \\n i opened my eyes . \\n `` fine . \\n okay . \\n there 's a cure . \\n but there 's not enough of it for everyone , so nobody wanted to tell you about it . '' \\n i winced as he smacked the steering wheel with dark-nailed fingers . \\n my mind 's eye whirled away from the alien reality to an image of the nurse sliding the syringe with the rabies shot into sam 's skin . \\n `` it 's a vaccination , sort of , it goes right in your veins . \\n but it hurts . \\n a lot . \\n are you sure you want it ? '' \\n `` this hurts , '' snarled jack . \\n `` fine . \\n if i take you to where it is , will you tell me where sam is ? '' \\n `` whatever ! \\n tell me where to go . \\n so help me god , if you 're lying , i 'll kill you . '' \\n i gave him directions to beck 's and prayed he 'd make it that far . \\n i retrieved my phone from my backpack . \\n the bronco swerved as jack 's attention focused on me . \\n `` what are you doing ? '' \\n `` i 'm calling beck . \\n he 's the guy with the cure . \\n i have to tell him not to give the last of it away before we get there . \\n is that all right ? '' \\n `` you seriously had better not be lying to me ... '' `` look . \\n this is the number i 'm dialing . \\n not the police . '' \\n beck 's number came back to me ; i was better at numbers than words . \\n it began to ring . \\n pick up . \\n pick up . \\n let this be the right decision . \\n `` hello ? '' \\n i recognized the voice . \\n `` hi . \\n beck , this is grace . '' \\n `` grace ? \\n sorry , your voice sounds familiar , but i - '' i talked over the top of him . \\n `` do you still have some of the stuff ? \\n the cure ? \\n please tell me you did n't use the last of it . '' \\n beck was silent . \\n i pretended like he 'd answered . \\n `` thank goodness . \\n look . \\n jack culpeper has me in the car . \\n he has sam somewhere and he wo n't tell me where he is unless he gets some of the cure . \\n we 're , like , ten minutes away . '' \\n beck said , very softly , `` damn . '' \\n for some reason , that made my chest shake ; it took me a moment to realize it was a swallowed sob . \\n `` yes . \\n so will you be there ? '' \\n `` yes . \\n of course . \\n grace-you still there ? \\n can he hear me ? '' \\n `` no . '' \\n `` be confident , okay ? \\n try not to be afraid . \\n do n't look him in the eyes , but be assertive . \\n we 'll be waiting at the house . \\n get him inside . \\n i ca n't come out or i 'll change and then we 're all screwed . '' \\n `` what 's he saying ? '' \\n jack demanded . \\n `` he 's telling me what door you should come in when you get there . \\n to get you in the fastest , so you wo n't change . \\n he ca n't use the cure on you if you 're a wolf . '' \\n `` good girl , '' beck said . \\n for some reason , beck 's unexpected kindness was hard to bear-it made tears prick my eyes where jack 's threats had n't . \\n `` we 'll be there soon . '' \\n i snapped the phone shut and looked at jack . \\n not right at his eyes , but at the side of his head . \\n `` pull straight into the driveway and they 'll have the front door unlocked . '' \\n `` how do i know i can trust you ? '' \\n i shrugged . \\n `` it 's like you said . \\n you know where sam is . \\n nothing 's going to happen to you , because we have to know where he is . '' \\n chapter forty-nine sam 40of cold clung to my skin . \\n earthy darkness pressed against my eyes , so heavy that i blinked to clear it from my irises . \\n when i did , i saw a dull white rectangle in front of me-the crack of a door . \\n without any other shapes to gauge by , i could n't tell if it was desperately close or horribly far away . \\n smells crowded around me , dusty , organic , chemical . \\n my breathing was loud in my ears , so wherever i was had to be small . \\n a tool shed ? \\n a crawl space ? \\n crap . \\n it was cold . \\n not cold enough for me to change , not yet . \\n but it would be soon . \\n i was lying down-why was i lying down ? \\n i staggered to my feet and bit my lip , hard , to keep from gasping aloud . \\n there was something wrong with my ankle . \\n i tried it again , carefully , a fragile fawn on new legs , and it gave underneath me . \\n i crashed sideways , arms wheeling , feeling for some kind of support . \\n my palms raked across a legion of spiked instruments of torture hung on the walls . \\n i had no idea what they were-cold , metallic , dirty . \\n for a moment i stayed on all fours , listening to my breathing , feeling blood well on my palms , and thinking about giving up . \\n i was so tired of fighting . \\n it felt like i 'd been fighting for weeks . \\n finally , i pulled myself back up and limped to the door , arms stretched out in front of me to protect my unarmored body from more surprises . \\n icy air seeped in through the crack in the door . \\n trickled into my body like water . \\n i reached for a handle , but there was nothing but ragged wood . \\n a splinter stuck into my fingers and i swore , very quietly . \\n then i leaned my shoulder into the door and pushed , thinking , please open please if there 's any justice in this world . \\n nothing . \\n chapter fifty grace 39of i picked up my backpack . \\n `` this is it . '' \\n it seemed stupid , somehow , for beck 's house to look exactly the same as when sam had brought me here to walk me to the golden wood , because the circumstances were so wildly different , but it did . \\n the only difference was beck 's hulking suv in the driveway . \\n jack was already pulling to the side of the road . \\n he took the keys out of the ignition and looked at me , eyes wary . \\n `` get out after i do . '' \\n i did as he said , waiting for him to come around and pull the door open . \\n i slid out of the seat and he grabbed my arm tightly . \\n his shoulders were thrust too far together and his mouth hung slightly open-i do n't think he even noticed . \\n i guess i should 've worried about him attacking me , but all i could think was he 's going to change and we wo n't know where sam is until too late . \\n i prayed sam was somewhere warm , somewhere out of winter 's reach . \\n `` hurry up , '' i said , tugging my arm against jack 's grip , almost jogging toward the front door . \\n `` we do n't have any time . '' \\n jack tried the front door ; it was unlocked , as promised , and he shoved me in first before slamming the door behind us . \\n my nose caught a brief hint of rosemary in the air-someone had been cooking , and for some reason , i remembered sam 's anecdote about cooking the steaks for beck-and then i heard a shout and a snarl from behind me . \\n both sounds came from jack . \\n this was n't the silent struggle of sam trying to stay human that i 'd seen before . \\n this was violent , angry , loud . \\n jack 's lips tore into a snarl and then his face ripped into a muzzle , his skin changing color in an instant . \\n he reached for me as if to hit me , but his hands buckled into paws , nails hard and dark . \\n his skin bulged and shimmered for a moment before each radical change , like a placenta covering a terrifying , feral infant . \\n i stared at the shirt that hung around the wolf 's midsection . \\n i could n't look away . \\n it was the only detail that could convince my mind that this animal really had just been jack . \\n this jack was as angry as he had been in the car , but now his anger had no direction , no human control . \\n his lips pulled back from his teeth and formed a snarl , but no sound appeared . \\n `` stand back ! '' \\n a man tore into the hall , surprisingly agile given his height , and ran directly at jack . \\n jack , off guard , crouched down defensively , and the man landed on the wolf with all his weight . \\n `` get down ! '' \\n snarled the man , and i flinched before i realized that he was talking to the wolf . \\n `` stay down . \\n this is my house . \\n you are nothing here . '' \\n he had a hand around jack 's muzzle and was shouting right into his face . \\n jack whistled through his clenched jaw , and beck forced his head to the ground . \\n beck 's eyes flitted up at me , and though he was holding a huge wolf to the ground with one hand , his voice was perfectly level . \\n `` grace ? \\n can you help ? '' \\n i 'd been standing perfectly still , watching . \\n `` yes . '' \\n `` grab the edge of the rug he 's sitting on . \\n we 're going to drag him to the bathroom . \\n it 's - '' `` i know where it is . '' \\n `` good . \\n let 's go . \\n i 'll try to help , but i have to keep my weight on him . '' \\n together , we pulled jack down the hall and to the bathroom where i 'd forced sam into the bathtub . \\n beck , half on the rug and half off , got behind jack and shoved him into the room , and i kicked the rest of the rug in after him . \\n beck leaped back and slammed the door , locking it . \\n the doorknob had been reversed so that the lock was on the outside , making me wonder how often this sort of thing had happened before . \\n beck heaved a deep breath , which seemed like an understatement , and looked at me . \\n `` are you all right ? \\n did he bite you ? '' \\n i shook my head , miserable . \\n `` that does n't matter , anyway . \\n how are we going to find sam now ? '' \\n beck jerked his head for me to follow him into the rosemary-scented kitchen . \\n i did , looking up warily when i saw another person sitting on the counter . \\n i would n't have been able to describe him as anything other than dark if anyone had asked me later . \\n he was just dark and still and silent , and smelled of wolf . \\n he had new-looking scars on his hands ; it had to be paul . \\n he did n't say anything , and beck did n't say anything to him as beck leaned against the counter and picked up a cell phone . \\n he punched in a number and put it on speakerphone . \\n he looked at me . \\n `` how angry is he with me ? \\n did he get rid of his cell phone ? '' \\n `` i do n't think so . \\n i did n't know the number . '' \\n beck stared at the phone and we listened to it ring , small and distant . \\n please pick up . \\n my heart was skipping uncontrollably . \\n i leaned on the kitchen island and looked at beck , at the square set of his shoulders , the square set of his jaw , the square line of eyebrows . \\n everything about him looked safe , honest , secure . \\n i wanted to trust him . \\n i wanted to believe that nothing bad could happen because beck was n't panicking . \\n there was a crackle at the other end of the line . \\n `` sam ? '' \\n beck leaned close into the phone . \\n the voice was badly broken up . \\n `` gr-t ? \\n ... you ? '' \\n `` it 's beck . \\n where are you ? '' '' \\n - ack . \\n grace ... jack to - ... co. '' the only thing i could understand was his distress . \\n i wanted to be there , wherever he was . \\n `` grace is here , '' beck said . \\n `` it 's under control . \\n where are you ? \\n are you safe ? '' \\n `` cold . '' \\n the one word came through , terribly clear . \\n i pushed off from the island . \\n standing still did n't seem to be an option . \\n beck 's voice was still even . \\n `` you are n't coming through very well . \\n try again . \\n tell me where you are . \\n clearly as you can . '' \\n `` tell grace ... call i-bel ... in ... shed some ... re . \\n i heard ... ago . '' \\n i came back to the counter , leaned over the island . \\n `` you want me to call isabel . \\n you 're in a shed on their property ? \\n she 's there ? '' '' \\n - es . '' \\n sam 's voice was emphatic . \\n `` grace ? '' \\n `` what ? '' '' \\n - ove you . '' \\n `` do n't say that , '' i said . \\n `` we 're getting you out . '' \\n `` hur - '' he hung up . \\n beck 's eyes flicked to me , and in them , i could see all the concern that his voice did n't reveal . \\n `` who 's isabel ? '' \\n `` jack 's sister . '' \\n it seemed to take too long to pull off my backpack and get my cell phone out of one of the pockets . \\n `` sam must be trapped somewhere on their property . \\n in a shed , or something . \\n if i get isabel on the phone , maybe she can find him . \\n if not , i 'm going now . '' \\n paul looked at the window , at the dying sun , and i knew he was thinking that i did n't have enough time to get to the culpepers ' before the temperature dropped . \\n no point thinking about that . \\n i found isabel 's number from when she 'd called me before and hit send . \\n it rang twice . \\n `` yeah . '' \\n `` isabel , it 's grace . '' \\n `` i 'm not an idiot . \\n i saw your number . '' \\n i wanted to reach through the phone and strangle her . \\n `` isabel , jack 's locked up sam somewhere near your house . '' \\n i cut off the beginning of her question . \\n `` i do n't know why . \\n but sam 's going to change if it gets much colder , and wherever he is , he 's trapped . \\n please tell me you 're at your house . '' \\n `` yeah . \\n i just got here . \\n i 'm in the house . \\n i did n't hear any commotion or anything . '' \\n `` do you have a shed or something ? '' \\n isabel made an irritated noise . \\n `` we have six outbuildings . '' \\n `` he has to be in one of them . \\n he called from inside a shed . \\n if the sun gets down behind the trees , it 's going to get cold in , like , two seconds . '' \\n `` i get it ! '' \\n snapped isabel . \\n there were rustling sounds . \\n `` i 'm getting my coat on . \\n i 'm going outside . \\n can you hear me ? \\n now i 'm outside . \\n i 'm freezing my ass off for you . \\n i 'm walking across the yard . \\n i 'm walking across the part of the grass my dog used to pee on before my damned brother ate her '' . \\n paul smiled faintly . \\n `` can you hurry it up ? '' \\n i demanded . \\n `` i 'm jogging to the first shed . \\n i 'm calling his name . \\n sam ! \\n sam ! \\n are you in there ? \\n i do n't hear anything . \\n if he 's turned into a wolf in one of these sheds and i let him out and he rips my face off , i 'm having my family sue you . '' \\n i heard a dim , faint crack . \\n `` hell . \\n this door is stuck . '' \\n another crack . \\n `` sam ? \\n wolf-boy ? \\n you in here ? \\n nothing in the lawn mower shed . \\n where is jack , anyway , if he did this ? '' \\n `` here . \\n he 's fine for now . \\n do you hear anything ? '' \\n `` i doubt he 's really fine . \\n he 's seriously screwed up , grace . \\n in the head , i mean . \\n and no , i 'd tell you if i heard something . \\n i 'm going to the next one . '' \\n paul rested the back of his hand on the glass of the window over the sink and winced . \\n he was right . \\n it was getting too cold . \\n `` call sam back , '' i begged beck . \\n `` tell him to shout so she can hear him . '' \\n beck picked up his phone , punched a button , and held it to his ear . \\n isabel sounded a little out of breath . \\n `` i 'm at the next one . \\n sam ! \\n you in there ? \\n dude ? '' \\n there was a nearly inaudible squeak as the door opened . \\n a pause . \\n `` unless he 's turned into a bicycle , he 's not in here , either . '' \\n `` how many more of them are there ? '' \\n i wanted to be there at the culpepers ' instead of isabel . \\n i 'd be faster than she was . \\n i 'd be screaming my lungs out to find him . \\n `` i told you . \\n four more . \\n only two more close . \\n the others are way out in the field behind the house . \\n they 're barns . '' \\n `` he has to be in one of the close ones . \\n he said it was a shed . '' \\n i looked at beck , who had his phone up to his ear still . \\n he looked back at me , shook his head . \\n no answer . \\n sam , why are n't you picking up ? \\n `` i 'm at the garden shed . \\n sam ! \\n sam , it 's isabel , if you 're a wolf in there , do n't rip my face off . '' \\n i could hear her breathing into the phone . \\n `` the door 's stuck like the other one . \\n i 'm kicking it with my expensive shoe and it 's pissing me off . '' \\n beck slammed his phone down on the counter and turned away from paul and me . \\n he linked his arms behind his head . \\n the motion was so sam that it pierced me . \\n `` i 've got it open . \\n it stinks . \\n there 's crap everywhere . \\n there 's nothing-oh . '' \\n she broke off , and her breathing came through the phone , heavier than before . \\n `` what ? \\n what ? '' \\n `` wait a sec-shut up-i 'm taking my coat off . \\n he 's here , okay ? \\n sam . \\n sam , look at me . \\n sam , i said , look at me , you bastard , you 're not turning into a wolf right now . \\n do n't you dare do this to her . '' \\n i sank slowly down beside the counter , cupping the phone against my head . \\n paul 's face did n't change ; he just watched me , still , quiet , dark , wolf . \\n i heard a smacking sound and a softly breathed swearword , then wind roaring across the speaker . \\n `` i 'm getting him inside . \\n thank god my parents are n't home tonight . \\n i 'll call you in a few minutes . \\n i need both my hands now . '' \\n the phone went silent in my hands . \\n i looked up at paul , who was still watching me , wondering what i should say to him , but i felt like he already knew . \\n chapter fifty-one grace 38of sleet danced off my windshield as i turned down the culpepers ' driveway , and the pines seemed to swallow the headlights . \\n the hulking house was nearly invisible in the darkness except for a handful of lights shining in the windows of the ground floor . \\n i pointed the bronco toward them like i was steering a ship toward lights on shore , and pulled up next to isabel 's white suv . \\n no other cars . \\n i grabbed sam 's extra coat and leaped out . \\n isabel greeted me at the back door , leading me through a smoky-smelling mudroom full of boots and dog leashes and antlers . \\n the smoky smell only increased as we left the mudroom and made our way through a beautiful , stark kitchen . \\n an uneaten sandwich sat , abandoned , on the counter . \\n isabel said , `` he 's in the living room next to the fire . \\n he just stopped throwing up before you got here . \\n he puked all over the carpet . \\n but that 's okay because i like having my parents pissed at me . \\n no point interrupting a constant pattern . '' \\n `` thank you , '' i said , more intensely grateful than the phrase conveyed . \\n i followed the smell of smoke to the living room . \\n luckily for isabel and her nonexistent fire-building skills , the ceiling was very high , and most of the smoke had drifted upward . \\n sam was a curved bundle next to the hearth , a fleece blanket wrapped around his shoulders . \\n an untouched mug of something sat beside him , still steaming . \\n i rushed over , flinching at the heat of the fire , and stopped short when i smelled him : sharp , earthy , wild . \\n a painfully familiar smell that i loved so well-but did n't want to smell right now . \\n the face he turned to me was human , though , and i crouched beside him and kissed him . \\n he took me carefully , as if either i or he might break , and closed his arms around me , laying his head on my shoulder . \\n i felt him shiver intermittently , despite the small , smoky fire that was nonetheless hot enough to burn my shoulder nearest to it . \\n i wanted him to say something . \\n this deadly quiet scared me . \\n i pulled away from him and ran my hands through his hair for a long minute before i said what needed to be said . \\n `` you are n't okay , are you ? '' \\n `` it 's like a roller coaster , '' sam said softly . \\n `` i climb and climb and climb toward winter , and as long as i do n't get to the very top , i can still slide back . '' \\n i looked away , into the fire , watching the very center of it , the very hottest part , until the colors and light lost meaning , burning my vision to white dancing lights . \\n `` and now you 're at the very top . '' \\n `` i think i might be . \\n i hope not . \\n but god-i feel like hell . '' \\n he took my hand with frigid fingers . \\n i could n't stand the silence . \\n `` beck wanted to come . \\n he could n't leave the house . '' \\n sam swallowed , loud enough for me to hear it . \\n i wondered if he was feeling sick again . \\n `` i wo n't see him again . \\n this is his last year . \\n i thought i was right to be angry at him , but it just seems stupid now . \\n i just ca n't - i just ca n't wrap my head around it . '' \\n i did n't know if he meant wrapping his head around whatever had made him angry with beck , or the roller coaster he was riding . \\n i just kept staring at that fire . \\n so hot . \\n a tiny little summer , self-contained and furious . \\n if only i could get that inside sam and keep him warm forever . \\n i was aware that isabel was standing in the doorway of the room , but she seemed far away . \\n `` i keep thinking about why i did n't change , '' i said slowly . \\n `` if i was born immune , or something . \\n but i was n't , you know ? \\n because i got that flu . \\n and because i still am not really-normal . \\n i can smell better and hear better . '' \\n i paused , trying to collect my thoughts . \\n `` and i think it was my dad . \\n i think it was when he left me in the car . \\n i got so hot , the doctors said i should 've died , remember ? \\n but i did n't . \\n i lived . \\n and i did n't turn into a wolf . '' \\n sam looked at me , his eyes sad . \\n `` you 're probably right . '' \\n `` but see , it could be a cure , could n't it ? \\n get you really hot ? '' \\n sam shook his head . \\n he was very pale . \\n `` i do n't think so , angel . \\n how hot was that bathwater you had me in ? \\n and-ulrik-he tried going to texas that year-it 's one hundred and three and one hundred and four degrees out there . \\n he 's still a wolf . \\n if that 's what cured you , it 's because you were little and because you had a crazy-high fever that burned you from the inside out . '' \\n `` you could induce a fever , '' i said suddenly . \\n but as soon as i said it , i shook my head . \\n `` but i do n't think there 's a medication to raise your temperature . '' \\n `` it is possible , '' isabel said from the door . \\n i looked to her . \\n she was leaning against the doorframe , arms crossed over her chest , the sleeves of her sweater filthy from whatever she 'd had to do to get sam out of the shed . \\n `` my mom works in a low-income clinic two days a week , and i heard her talking about a guy who had a fever of one hundred and seven . \\n he had meningitis . '' \\n `` what happened to him ? '' \\n i asked . \\n sam dropped my hand , turned his face away . \\n `` he died . '' \\n isabel shrugged . \\n `` but maybe a werewolf would n't . \\n maybe that 's why you did n't die as a kid , because you were bitten right before your idiot dad left you in the car to cook . '' \\n beside me , sam scrambled to his feet and started coughing . \\n `` not on the frigging rug ! '' \\n isabel said . \\n i jumped up as sam braced his hands on his knees and retched without throwing anything up . \\n he turned around to me , shaky , and something that i saw in his eyes made my stomach drop out from under me . \\n the room stank of wolf . \\n for a dizzying moment , it was me and sam , my face buried in his ruff , one thousand miles from here . \\n sam squeezed his eyes shut for a second , and when he opened them , he said , `` sorry . \\n grace-i know this is an awful thing to ask . \\n but could we go to beck 's ? \\n i have to see him again , if this is - '' he stopped . \\n but i knew what he 'd been about to say . \\n the end . \\n chapter fifty-two grace 33of driving on cloudy nights had always unsettled me . \\n it was as if the low cloud cover not only hid the moonlight but also robbed the headlights of any power , siphoning away their light the second it hit the air . \\n now , with sam , i felt like i was driving down a black tunnel that kept getting ever narrower . \\n the sleet tapped the windshield ; both my hands gripped the wheel as the car tires bucked on the slick road . \\n the heat was on absolute high , and i wanted to believe that sam looked a little better . \\n isabel had poured his coffee into a travel mug , and i 'd forced him to drink it as we drove , despite his nausea . \\n it seemed to be helping , more than the external heat sources had , anyway . \\n i took this as a possible reinforcement of our new theory of internal heat . \\n `` i 'm thinking more about your theory , '' sam said , as if reading my mind . \\n `` it makes a lot of sense . \\n but you 'd have to get your hands on something to induce the fever-maybe meningitis , like isabel said-and i 'm thinking that 's going to be unpleasant . '' \\n `` aside from the fever itself , you mean ? '' \\n `` yeah . \\n aside from that . \\n like dangerously unpleasant . \\n especially considering you ca n't exactly do animal testing first to find out if it 's going to work . '' \\n sam glanced at me quickly to see if i had gotten the joke . \\n `` hardly funny . '' \\n `` better than nothing . '' \\n `` granted . '' \\n sam reached over and touched my cheek . \\n `` but i 'd be willing to try it . \\n for you . \\n to stay with you . '' \\n he said it so simply , so unaffectedly , that it took me a moment to get the statement 's full impact . \\n i wanted to say something , but i felt like i had no breath at all . \\n `` i do n't want to do this anymore , grace . \\n it 's not good enough anymore to watch you from the woods , not now that i 've been with you-the real thing . \\n i ca n't just watch anymore . \\n i 'd rather risk whatever could happen - '' `` death - '' `` yeah , death-than watch all this slip away . \\n i ca n't do that , grace . \\n i want to try . \\n only-i think i 'd have to be human for it to have a chance . \\n it does n't seem like you could kill the wolf while you were the wolf . '' \\n i was trembling . \\n not because it was cold , but because it sounded possible . \\n horrible , deadly , awful-possible . \\n and i wanted it . \\n i wanted to never have to give up this feeling of his fingers on my cheek or the sad sound of his voice . \\n i should 've told him , no , it 's not worth it , but that would 've been a lie of such epic proportions that i could n't do it . \\n `` grace , '' sam said , abruptly . \\n `` if you want me . '' \\n `` what ? '' \\n i said , and then realized what he had said . \\n it seemed impossible that he had to ask . \\n i could n't be that hard to read . \\n then i realized-stupid , slow me-that he wanted to hear it . \\n he told me all the time how he felt , and i was just ... stoic . \\n i do n't think i 'd ever told him . \\n `` of course i do . \\n sam , i love you , you know i do . \\n i 've loved you for years . \\n you know that . '' \\n sam curled his arms around himself . \\n `` i do . \\n but i wanted to hear you say it . '' \\n he reached toward my hand before realizing i could n't take it off the wheel ; instead he made a knot of my hair around his fingers and rested his fingertips against my neck . \\n i imagined i could feel his pulse and my pulse syncing up through that tiny bit of contact . \\n this could be mine forever . \\n he slouched back in his seat , looking tired , and leaned his face on his shoulder to look at me while he played with my hair . \\n he started to hum a song , and then , after a few bars , he sang it . \\n quietly , sort of half-sung , half-spoken , incredibly gentle . \\n i did n't catch all the words , but it was about his summer girl . \\n me . \\n maybe his forever girl . \\n his yellow eyes were half-lidded as he sang , and in that golden moment , hanging taut in the middle of an icecovered landscape like a single bubble of summer nectar , i could see how my life could be stretched out in front of me . \\n the bronco lurched violently , and a heartbeat later , i saw the deer roll up over the hood . \\n a crack raced across the windshield , exploding a second later into a thousand spiderwebbed fractures . \\n i hit the brake , but nothing happened . \\n not even a whisper of a response . \\n turn , sam said , or maybe i imagined him saying it , but when i turned the wheel , the bronco kept going straight , sliding , sliding , sliding . \\n i remembered , in the back of my head , my dad saying , steer into the skid , and i did , but it was too late . \\n there was a sound like a bone breaking , and there was a dead deer on the car and in the car and glass was everywhere and god , a tree shoved through my hood , and there was blood on my knuckles from the glass , and i was shaking and sam was looking at me with this look on his face like oh , no , and then i realized that the car was n't running and there was frigid air trickling in the jagged hole in the windshield . \\n i wasted a moment staring at him . \\n then i tried the engine , which would n't even respond when i turned the key . \\n i said : `` we call 911 . \\n they 'll come get us . '' \\n sam 's mouth made a sad little line , and he nodded , as if that really would work . \\n i punched in the number and reported the accident , talking fast , trying to guess where we might be , and then i took off my coat , careful not to drag the sleeves over my bloody knuckles , and i threw it on top of sam . \\n he sat quietly , unmoving , as i grabbed a blanket from the backseat and threw it on top of him , too , and then i slid across the seat and leaned against him , hoping to lend my body heat to him . \\n `` call beck , please , '' sam said , and i did . \\n i put it on speakerphone and set it on the dash . \\n `` grace ? '' \\n beck 's voice . \\n `` beck , '' sam said . \\n `` it 's me . '' \\n there was a pause , and then , `` sam . \\n i - '' `` there 's no time , '' sam said . \\n `` we 've hit a deer . \\n we 're wrecked . '' \\n `` god . \\n where are you ? \\n is the car running ? '' \\n `` too far . \\n we called 911 . \\n the engine 's dead . '' \\n sam gave beck a moment to realize what that meant . \\n `` beck , i 'm sorry i did n't come by . \\n there are things i need to say - '' `` no , listen to me first , sam . \\n those kids . \\n i need you to know i recruited them . \\n they knew . \\n they knew all along . \\n i did n't do it against their will . \\n not like you . \\n i 'm so sorry , sam . \\n i 've never stopped being sorry . '' \\n the words were meaningless to me , but obviously not to sam . \\n his eyes were too bright , and he blinked . \\n `` i do n't regret it . \\n i love you , beck . '' \\n `` i love you , too , sam . \\n you 're the best of us , and nothing can change that . '' \\n sam shuddered , the first sign i 'd seen of the cold acting on him . \\n `` i have to go , '' he said . \\n `` there 's no more time . '' \\n `` good-bye , sam . '' \\n `` bye , beck . '' \\n sam nodded to me and i hit the end button . \\n for a second he was still , blinking . \\n then he shook off all the blankets and coats so that his arms were free and he wrapped them around me as tightly as he could . \\n i felt him shuddering , shuddering against me as he buried his face in my hair . \\n i said , uselessly , `` sam , do n't go . '' \\n sam cupped my face in his hands and looked me in the eyes . \\n his eyes were yellow , sad , wolf , mine . \\n `` these stay the same . \\n remember that when you look at me . \\n remember it 's me . \\n please . '' \\n please do n't go . \\n sam let go of me and spread out his arms , gripping the dash with one hand and the back of his seat with the other . \\n he bowed his head and i watched his shoulders ripple and shake , watched the silent agony of the change until that one soft , awful cry , just when he lost himself . \\n chapter fifty-three sam 33of crashing into the trembling void stretching my hand to you losing myself to frigid regret is this fragile love a way to say good-bye chapter fifty-four grace 32of when the paramedics arrived , i was curled on the passenger seat in a pile of coats , my hands pressed against my face . \\n `` miss , are you all right ? '' \\n i did n't answer , just put my hands on my lap and looked at my fingers , covered with bloody tears . \\n `` miss , are you alone ? '' \\n i nodded . \\n chapter fifty-five sam 32of i watched her , like i 'd always watched her . \\n thoughts were slippery and transient , faint scents on a frigid wind , too far away to catch . \\n she sat just outside the wood near the swing , curled small , until the cold shook her , and still she did n't move . \\n for a long time , i did n't know what she was doing . \\n i watched her . \\n part of me wanted to go to her , though instinct sang against it . \\n the desire sparked a thought which sparked a memory of golden woods , days floating around me and falling around me , days lying still and crumpled on the ground . \\n but i realized then what she was doing , folded there , trembling with the vicious cold . \\n she was waiting , waiting for the cold to shake her into another form . \\n maybe that unfamiliar scent i caught from her was hope . \\n she waited to change , and i waited to change , and we both wanted what we could n't have . \\n finally , night crept across the yard , lengthening the shadows , pulling them out of the woods until they covered the whole world . \\n i watched her . \\n the door opened . \\n i shrank farther into the dark . \\n a man came out , pulled the girl from the ground . \\n the light from the house glistened off the frozen tracks on her face . \\n i watched her . \\n thoughts , distant , fled with her absence . \\n after she disappeared into the house , there was only this : longing . \\n chapter fifty-six grace 34of their howls were the hardest thing to bear . \\n as terrible as the days were , the nights were worse ; days were just listless preparations to somehow make it through another night populated by their voices . \\n i lay in bed and hugged his pillow until there was no more of his scent caught in it . \\n i slept in his chair in dad 's study until it had my shape instead of his . \\n i walked barefoot through the house in a private grief i could n't share with anyone . \\n the only person i could share with , olivia , could n't be reached by phone , and my car-the car i could n't even bear to think of-was useless and broken . \\n and so it was just me in the house and the hours stretched out before me and the unchanging , leafless trees of boundary wood outside my window . \\n the night i heard him howl was the worst . \\n the others began first , like they had for the last three nights . \\n i sank down into the leather chair in dad 's study , buried my face in the last samscented t-shirt of his that i had , and pretended that it was just a recording of wolves , not real wolves . \\n not real people . \\n and then , for the first time since the crash , i heard his howl join in with them . \\n it tore my heart out , because i heard his voice . \\n the wolves sang slowly behind him , bittersweet harmony , but all i heard was sam . \\n his howl trembled , rose , fell in anguish . \\n i listened for a long time . \\n i prayed for them to stop , to leave me alone , but at the same time i was desperately afraid that they would . \\n long after the other voices had dropped away , sam kept howling , very soft and slow . \\n when he finally fell silent , the night felt dead . \\n sitting still was intolerable . \\n i stood up , paced , clenched and unclenched my hands into fists . \\n finally i took the guitar that sam had played and i screamed and smashed it into pieces on dad 's desk . \\n when dad came down from his room , he found me sitting in the middle of a sea of splintered wood and snapped strings , like a boat carrying music had crashed on a rocky shore . \\n chapter fifty-seven grace 35of the first time i picked up my phone after the crash , it was snowing . \\n light , delicate flakes drifted by the black square of my window , like flower petals . \\n i would n't have picked it up , but it was the one person i had been trying to contact since the crash . \\n `` olivia ? '' \\n `` g-gr-r-ace ? '' \\n olivia , barely recognizable . \\n she was sobbing . \\n `` olivia , shh-what 's wrong ? '' \\n that was a stupid question . \\n i knew what was wrong with her . \\n `` re-remember i told you i knew about the wolves ? '' \\n she was taking big gasps of air between the words . \\n `` i did n't tell you about the hospital . \\n jack - '' `` bit you , '' i said . \\n `` yes , '' olivia sobbed out the word . \\n `` i did n't think anything would happen , because days went by and i felt the same ! '' \\n my limbs fell slack . \\n `` you changed ? '' \\n `` i-i ca n't - i - '' i closed my eyes , imagining the scene . \\n god . \\n `` where are you now ? '' \\n `` at the b-bus stop . '' \\n she paused , sniffing . \\n `` it 's c-cold . '' \\n `` oh , olivia . \\n olivia , come over here . \\n stay with me . \\n we 'll figure this out . \\n i 'd come , but i do n't have a car yet . '' \\n olivia began to sob again . \\n i stood up and shut my bedroom door . \\n not that mom would hear me ; she was upstairs , anyway . \\n `` olivia , it 's okay . \\n i 'm not going to freak out . \\n i saw sam change and i did n't freak out . \\n i know what it 's like . \\n calm down , okay ? \\n i ca n't come get you . \\n i do n't have a car . \\n you 're going to have to drive over here . '' \\n i calmed her down for another few minutes and told her i 'd have the front door unlocked when she got there . \\n for the first time since the crash , i felt closer to me again . \\n when she arrived , looking red-eyed and disheveled , i pushed her toward the bathroom for a shower and got her a change of clothes . \\n i sat on the closed toilet lid while she stood in the hot water . \\n `` i 'll tell you my story if you tell me yours , '' i told her . \\n `` i want to know when jack bit you . '' \\n `` i told you how i met him , taking pictures of the wolves , and how i fed him . \\n it was so stupid that i did n't tell you-i was just so guilty about fighting with you that i did n't tell you right away , and then i started cutting classes to help him out , and then i felt like i could n't tell you without ... i do n't know what i thought . \\n i 'm sorry . '' \\n `` it 's water under the bridge now , '' i said . \\n `` what was he like ? \\n did he force you to help him ? '' \\n `` no , '' olivia said , `` he was pretty nice , actually , when things went his way . \\n he got pretty angry when he changed , but it looked painful . \\n and he kept asking about the wolves , wanting to see photos , and we talked , and after he found out that you 'd been bitten - '' `` found out ? '' \\n i echoed . \\n `` okay , i told him ! \\n i did n't know it was going to make him crazy ! \\n he went on and on about a cure after that , and he tried to get me to tell him how to fix him . \\n and then he , um , he ... '' she wiped her eyes . \\n `` bit me . '' \\n `` wait . \\n he bit you when he was human ? '' \\n `` yeah . '' \\n i shuddered . \\n `` god . \\n how awful . \\n sick bastard . \\n so you 've been dealing with this all the time , by yourself ? '' \\n `` who would i tell ? '' \\n olivia said . \\n `` i thought sam was one , because of his eyes-because i thought i recognized them from my wolf photos-but he told me he was wearing contacts when i met him . \\n so i knew i either had it wrong or he just was n't going to help me , anyway . '' \\n `` you should 've told me . \\n i already told you about the werewolves , anyway . '' \\n `` i know . \\n i was just-guilty . \\n i was just '' - she shut off the water - `` stupid . \\n i do n't know . \\n what can i do , anyway ? \\n how was sam human so much ? \\n i saw him . \\n he waited in the bronco for you all the time , and he never changed . '' \\n i handed her a towel over the top of the curtain . \\n `` come into my room . \\n i 'll tell you . '' \\n olivia stayed with me overnight , shaking and kicking so much that she eventually made a nest of blankets and my sleeping bag next to the bed so that we could both sleep . \\n after a late breakfast , we went to get olivia some toothpaste and other toiletries-mom had ridden to work with dad so that i could use her car . \\n on the way back from the store , my cell phone rang . \\n olivia picked up the phone without answering the call and read the number off to me . \\n beck . \\n did i really want to do this ? \\n i sighed and held out my hand for the phone . \\n `` hello ? '' \\n `` grace . '' \\n `` yes . '' \\n `` i 'm sorry to call you , '' beck said . \\n his voice sounded flat . \\n `` i know the last couple days must 've been hard for you . '' \\n was i supposed to say something ? \\n i hoped not , because i could n't think of anything . \\n my brain felt cloudy . \\n `` grace ? '' \\n `` i 'm here . '' \\n `` i 'm calling about jack . \\n he 's doing better now , he 's more stable , and it wo n't be too long before he changes for the winter . \\n but he 's still got a couple weeks of swapping back and forth , i think . '' \\n my brain was n't too cloudy to realize how much beck was trusting me at this point . \\n i felt vaguely honored . \\n `` so he 's not still locked in the bathroom ? '' \\n beck laughed , not a funny laugh , but nice to hear , anyway . \\n `` no , he 's graduated from the bathroom to the basement . \\n but i 'm afraid , um , i 'm going to change soon-i almost did this morning . \\n and that would leave jack in a very bad place for the next few weeks . \\n i hate to ask you this , because it puts you in danger of getting bitten-but maybe you could keep an eye on him until he changes ? '' \\n i paused . \\n `` beck , i 've been bitten already . '' \\n `` god ! '' \\n `` no , no , '' i added hurriedly . \\n `` not recently . \\n many years ago . '' \\n beck 's voice was strange . \\n `` you 're the girl that sam saved , are n't you ? '' \\n `` yeah . '' \\n `` and you never changed . '' \\n `` no . '' \\n `` how long have you known sam ? '' \\n `` we only met in person this year . \\n but i 've watched him ever since he saved me . '' \\n i pulled into the driveway but did n't turn the engine off . \\n olivia leaned over , cranked up the heat , and lay back in her seat with closed eyes . \\n `` i 'd like to come over before you change . \\n to just talk , if that 's okay . '' \\n `` that would be more than okay . \\n but it 'll have to be soon , i 'm afraid . \\n i 'm just getting to the point where i ca n't turn back now . '' \\n crap . \\n my phone was beeping another call through . \\n `` this afternoon ? '' \\n i asked . \\n when he agreed , i said , `` i have to go-i 'm sorry-someone is calling me . '' \\n we said good-bye and i clicked over to the other call . \\n `` holy crap , grace , how many times were you going to let it ring ? \\n eighteen ? \\n twenty ? \\n one hundred ? '' \\n it was isabel ; i had n't heard from her since the day after the crash , when i 'd filled her in on where jack was . \\n i replied , `` for all you know , i was in class , and i was being murdered for my phone ringing during it . '' \\n `` you were n't in class . \\n anyway . \\n i need your help . \\n my mom saw another case of meningitis-the worse sort of meningitis-at the clinic where she works . \\n while i was there , i drew the guy 's blood . \\n three vials . '' \\n i blinked several times before i figured out what she was saying . \\n `` you what ?! \\n why ? '' \\n `` grace , i thought you were at the top of the class . \\n clearly the sliding scale has done wonders for you . \\n try to focus . \\n while mom was on the phone , i pretended to be a nurse and i drew his blood . \\n his nasty , infected blood . '' \\n `` you know how to draw blood ? '' \\n `` yes , i know how to draw blood ! \\n does n't everyone ? \\n are you not getting what i 'm saying ? \\n three vials . \\n one for jack . \\n one for sam . \\n one for olivia . \\n i need you to help me get jack over to the clinic . \\n the blood 's in the fridge there . \\n i 'm afraid to take it out in case the bacteria die or whatever it is that bacteria do . \\n anyway , i do n't know where this guy 's house is , where jack is . '' \\n `` you want to inject them . \\n to give them meningitis . '' \\n `` no , i want to give them malaria . \\n yes , stupid . \\n i want to give them meningitis . \\n the main symptom is-tada-a fever . \\n and if we 're being honest , i do n't give a crap if you do it to sam and olivia . \\n it probably wo n't work on sam , anyway , because he 's a wolf already . \\n but i figured i had to get enough blood for all of them if i wanted to get you to help me . '' \\n `` isabel , i would 've helped you , anyway . '' \\n i sighed . \\n `` i 'm going to give you an address . \\n meet me there in an hour . '' \\n chapter fifty-eight grace 42of being in beck 's basement made me both the happiest and the saddest i 'd felt since sam had changed into a wolf , because seeing beck there , in his own world , was like seeing sam again . \\n it started when we left olivia puking in the bathroom and met beck at the top of the basement stairs-it was too cold for him to meet us at the front door-and i realized that sam had inherited so many of his mannerisms and movements from beck . \\n even the simplest gestures : reaching over to brush up a light switch , inclining his head for us to follow him , awkwardly ducking to avoid a low beam at the bottom of the stairs . \\n so much like sam that it hurt . \\n then we reached the bottom of the stairs and i caught my breath . \\n the large , main room of the basement was filled with books . \\n not just a few . \\n it was a library . \\n the walls were lined with recessed shelves that climbed to the top of the low ceiling , and they were stuffed full . \\n even without getting close to the shelves , i could see that they were categorized : tall , fat atlases and encyclopedias on one shelf ; short , colorful paperbacks with rumpled edges on several others ; big photo books with block letters on their spines ; hardcover novels with glistening dust jackets . \\n i stepped slowly into the middle of the room and stood on the dusky orange carpet , turning slowly to see them all . \\n and the smell-the smell of sam was everywhere in this room , like he was here with me , holding my hand , looking at all these books with me , waiting for me to say `` i love it . '' \\n i was about to break the silence by saying something like `` i can see where sam got his reading habit '' when beck said , almost apologetically , `` when you spend a lot of time inside , you do a lot of reading . '' \\n i remembered , then , abruptly , what sam had told me about beck : this was his last year as a human . \\n he would never read these books again . \\n my words were stolen from me , and then i just looked at beck and managed , stupidly , `` i love books . '' \\n he smiled , like he knew . \\n then he looked at isabel , who was craning her neck as if jack must be stuffed on one of the shelves . \\n `` jack 's probably in the other room , playing video games , '' beck said . \\n isabel followed beck 's gaze to the doorway . \\n `` will he tear out my throat if i go in there ? '' \\n beck shrugged . \\n `` no more than usual , i 'd think . \\n that 's the warmest room in the house , and i think he feels more comfortable in there . \\n though he still changes every so often . \\n just pay attention . '' \\n it was interesting how he talked about jack-more animal than human . \\n as if he were advising isabel on how to approach the gorillas at the zoo . \\n after isabel had vanished into the other room , beck gestured toward one of the two squashy red chairs in the room . \\n `` have a seat . '' \\n i was glad to settle down into one of the chairs . \\n it smelled of beck and a few other wolves , but mostly of sam . \\n it was so easy to imagine him down here , curled in this spot , reading and developing an obnoxiously large vocabulary . \\n i rested my head against the side of the chair to pretend i was curled in sam 's arms and turned to look at beck , who sat down in the chair opposite . \\n not properly , but crashed back into it with his legs kicked out . \\n he looked tired . \\n `` i 'm sort of surprised sam kept you a secret all this time . '' \\n `` are you ? '' \\n he shrugged . \\n `` i guess i should n't be . \\n i did n't tell him about my wife . '' \\n `` he knew . \\n he told me about her . '' \\n beck laughed , short and fond . \\n `` i should n't be surprised about that , either . \\n keeping a secret from sam was impossible . \\n not to be cliche , but he could read people like a book . '' \\n we were both referring to him in past tense , like he was dead . \\n `` do you think i 'll ever see him again ? '' \\n his face was faraway , unreadable . \\n `` i think this year was his last . \\n i really do . \\n i know it 's mine . \\n i do n't know why he got so few years . \\n that 's just not normal . \\n i mean , it varies , but i was bitten a little over twenty years ago . '' \\n `` twenty ? '' \\n beck nodded . \\n `` in canada . \\n i was twenty-eight , a rising star at my firm , and i was hiking on vacation . '' \\n `` what about the rest of them ? \\n where are they from ? '' \\n `` from all over . \\n when i heard that there were wolves in minnesota , i thought there was a good chance they could be like me . \\n so i went looking , found out i was right , and paul took me under his wing . \\n paul 's - '' `` the black wolf . '' \\n he nodded . \\n `` do you want coffee ? \\n i could murder for coffee , if you do n't mind the expression . '' \\n i was intensely grateful . \\n `` that would be wonderful . \\n if you point me in the direction of the pot , i 'll make it . '' \\n he pointed it out , hidden in a cranny between the shelves , next to a tiny refrigerator . \\n `` and you can keep talking . '' \\n he sounded humored . \\n `` what about ? '' \\n `` the pack . \\n what it 's like , being a wolf . \\n sam . \\n why you changed sam . '' \\n i paused , coffee filter in hand . \\n `` yes . \\n that one . \\n i want to know that one in particular . '' \\n beck crumpled his face in his hand . \\n `` god , the worst one . \\n i changed sam because i was a selfish bastard without a soul . '' \\n i measured coffee grounds . \\n i heard the regret in his voice , but i was n't letting him off the hook . \\n `` that 's not a reason . '' \\n deep sigh . \\n `` i know . \\n jen-my wife-had just died . \\n she was a terminal cancer patient when we met , so i knew it was going to happen , but i was young and stupid and thought maybe a miracle would happen and we 'd live happily ever after . \\n anyway . \\n no miracle . \\n i was depressed . \\n i thought about killing myself , but the funny thing about having wolf in you is that suicide does n't seem like a very good idea . \\n did you ever notice that animals do n't kill themselves on purpose ? '' \\n i had n't . \\n i made a note of it . \\n `` anyway , i was in duluth in the summer , and i saw sam with his parents . \\n god , this sounds awful , does n't it ? \\n but it was n't like that . \\n jen and i talked all the time about having kids , even though we both knew it would never happen . \\n hell , she was only supposed to live for another eight months . \\n how could she have had a baby ? \\n anyway , i saw sam . \\n there he was , with his yellow eyes , just like a real wolf , and i was totally obsessed with the idea . \\n and-you do n't have to tell me , grace , i know this was wrong-but i saw him with his silly , vapid parents , them just as clueless as a pair of pigeons , and i thought , i could be better for him . \\n i could teach him more . '' \\n i did n't say anything , and beck leaned his forehead into his hand again . \\n his voice was centuries old . \\n i did n't say anything , but he groaned . \\n `` god , i know , grace . \\n i know . \\n but you know the stupid thing ? \\n i actually like who i am . \\n i mean , not at first . \\n it was a curse . \\n but it came to be like someone who loves summer and winter . \\n does that make sense ? \\n i knew that eventually i 'd lose myself , but i came to terms with that a long time ago . \\n i thought sam would get over it , too . '' \\n i found the mugs in a little cubby above the coffeemaker and pulled two of them out . \\n `` but he did n't . \\n milk ? '' \\n `` a little . \\n not too much . '' \\n he sighed . \\n `` it 's hell for him . \\n i made a personal hell for him . \\n he needs that sort of self-awareness to feel alive , and when he loses that and becomes a wolf ... it 's hell . \\n he is absolutely the best person i 've ever met in the world , and i absolutely ruined him . \\n i have regretted it every day for years . '' \\n he might 've deserved it , but i could n't let him get any lower . \\n i brought him a mug and sat back down . \\n `` he loves you , beck . \\n he may hate being a wolf , but he loves you . \\n and i have to tell you , it 's killing me to sit here with you , because everything about you reminds me of him . \\n if you admire him , it 's because you made him who he is . '' \\n beck looked strangely vulnerable then , his hands wrapped around the coffee mug , looking at me through the steam above it . \\n he was silent for a long moment , and then he said , `` the regret will be one of the things i 'll be glad to lose . '' \\n i frowned at him . \\n sipped the coffee . \\n `` will you forget everything ? '' \\n `` you do n't forget anything . \\n you just see it differently . \\n through a wolf 's brain . \\n some things become completely unimportant when you 're a wolf . \\n other things are emotions wolves just do n't feel . \\n we lose those . \\n but the most important things-we can hold on to those . \\n most of us . '' \\n like love . \\n i thought of sam watching me , before we had met as humans , and me watching back . \\n falling in love , as impossible as it should 've been . \\n my gut squeezed , horribly , and for a moment , i could n't speak . \\n `` you were bitten , '' beck said . \\n i 'd heard this before , this question without a question mark . \\n i nodded . \\n `` a little more than six years ago . '' \\n `` but you never changed . '' \\n i related the story of getting locked in the car , and then explained the theory of a possible cure isabel and i had developed . \\n beck sat quietly for a long moment , rubbing a small circle in the side of his mug with one of his fingers , staring blankly at the books on the wall . \\n finally , he nodded . \\n `` it might work . \\n i can see how it might work . \\n but i think you 'd have to be human when you got infected for it to work . '' \\n `` that 's what sam said . \\n he said he thought if you were killing the wolf , you should n't be a wolf when you were infected . '' \\n beck 's eyes were still unfocused as he thought . \\n `` god , but it 's risky . \\n you could n't treat the meningitis until after you were sure the fever had killed the wolf . \\n bacterial meningitis has an incredible fatality rate , even if you catch it early and treat it from the beginning . '' \\n `` sam told me he 'd risk dying for the cure . \\n do you think he meant it ? '' \\n `` absolutely , '' beck said , without hesitation . \\n `` but he 's a wolf . \\n and likely to stay that way for the rest of his life . '' \\n i dropped my eyes to my half-empty mug , noticing the way the liquid changed color just at the very edges of the rim . \\n `` i was thinking we could bring him to the clinic , just to see if he 'd change in the heat of the building . '' \\n there was a pause , but i did n't look up to see what expression beck wore during it . \\n he said gently , `` grace . '' \\n i swallowed , still looking at the coffee . \\n `` i know . '' \\n `` i 've watched wolves for twenty-odd years . \\n it 's predictable . \\n we get to the end ... and it 's the end . '' \\n i felt like a stubborn child . \\n `` but he changed this year when he should n't have , right ? \\n when he was shot , he made himself human . '' \\n beck took a long drink of coffee . \\n i heard his fingers tapping the side of the mug . \\n `` and to save you . \\n he made himself human to save you . \\n i do n't know how he did it . \\n or why . \\n but he did . \\n i always thought it must have had something to do with adrenaline , tricking the body into thinking it was warm . \\n i know he 's tried to do it other times , too , but he never managed it . '' \\n i closed my eyes and let myself imagine sam carrying me . \\n i could almost see it , smell it , feel it . \\n `` hell . '' \\n beck did n't say anything else for a long time . \\n then , again : `` hell . \\n it 's what he would want . \\n he 'd want to try . '' \\n he drained his coffee . \\n `` i 'll help you . \\n what were you thinking ? \\n drugging him for the trip ? '' \\n i had been thinking about it , in fact , ever since isabel had called . \\n `` i think we 'll have to , right ? \\n he wo n't stand it otherwise . '' \\n `` benadryl , '' beck said , matter-of-fact . \\n `` i 've got some upstairs . \\n it 'll make him groggy and put him enough out of it that he wo n't go crazy in the car . '' \\n `` the only thing i could n't work out was how to get him here . \\n i have n't seen him since the accident . '' \\n i was cautious with my words . \\n i could n't let myself get hopeful . \\n i just could n't . \\n beck 's voice was certain . \\n `` i can do it . \\n i 'll get him . \\n i 'll make him come . \\n we 'll put the benadryl in some hamburger or something . '' \\n he stood up and took my coffee mug from me . \\n `` i like you , grace . \\n i wish sam could 've had - '' he stopped , put his hand on my shoulder . \\n his voice was so kind i thought i would cry . \\n `` it might work , grace . \\n it might work . '' \\n i could see that he did n't believe , but i saw , too , that he wanted to . \\n for right now , that was enough . \\n chapter fifty-nine grace 38of a thin layer of snow dusted the ground as beck walked into the backyard , his shoulders dark and square underneath his sweater . \\n inside , isabel and olivia stood with me by the glass door , ready to help , but i felt like i was alone , watching beck slowly walk out into his last day as a human . \\n one of his hands held a gob of red , raw meat laced with benadryl , and the other shook uncontrollably . \\n a dozen yards from the house , beck halted , dropped the meat to the ground , and then walked several paces toward the woods . \\n for a moment he stood there , his head cocked in a way that i recognized . \\n listening . \\n `` what is he doing ? '' \\n isabel demanded , but i did n't answer . \\n beck cupped his hands around his mouth , and even inside , i could hear him clearly . \\n `` sam ! '' \\n he shouted it again , `` sam ! \\n i know you 're out there ! \\n sam ! \\n sam ! \\n remember who you are ? \\n sam ! '' \\n shaking , beck kept shouting sam 's name to the empty , frigid woods , until he stumbled and caught himself just before falling . \\n i pressed my fingers to my lips as tears ran down my cheeks . \\n beck shouted sam 's name one more time , and then his shoulders hunched up , buckling and twisting , his scrambling hands and feet scarring the layer of snow around him . \\n his clothing hung on him , vast and tangled , and then he backed out of it , shaking his head . \\n the gray wolf stood in the middle of the yard , looking toward the glass doors , his eyes watching us watching him . \\n he stepped away from the clothing he would never wear again , and then he froze , turning his head toward the woods . \\n from between the stark black pines , another wolf emerged , head low and cautious , snow dusted over his ruff . \\n his eyes found me , behind the glass . \\n sam . \\n chapter sixty grace 36of the evening was steel gray , the sky an endless expanse of frozen clouds waiting for snow and for night . \\n outside the suv , the tires crunched along salted roads , and sleet tapped on the windshield . \\n inside , behind the wheel , isabel kept complaining about the `` wet mutt smell , '' but to me it was pine and earth , rain and musk . \\n and behind it , the sharp , contagious edge of anxiety . \\n in the passenger seat , jack kept whining softly , halfway between animal and human . \\n olivia sat beside me in the backseat , her fingers knotted so tightly in mine that it hurt . \\n sam was behind us . \\n when we had lifted him into the suv , his body was heavy with drug-induced sleep . \\n now , his breaths were deep and uneven , and i strained to listen to them over the sound of slush spraying from the tires , to maintain some kind of connection with him when i could n't touch him . \\n with him drugged , i could 've sat with him and run my fingers through his fur , but it would 've been torment for him . \\n he was an animal now . \\n back in his world , far away from me . \\n isabel pulled up in front of the little clinic . \\n at this hour , the parking lot was dark and unlit ; the clinic itself was a little gray square . \\n it did n't look like a place to work miracles . \\n it looked like a place you came when you were sick and had no money . \\n i pushed the thought out of my head . \\n `` i stole the keys from mom , '' isabel said . \\n to her credit , she did n't sound nervous . \\n `` come on . \\n jack , can you try the hell not to savage someone before we get inside ? '' \\n jack muttered something unrepeatable . \\n i looked in the back ; sam was on his feet , swaying . \\n `` isabel , hurry up . \\n the benadryl 's wearing off . '' \\n isabel wrenched up the parking brake . \\n `` if we get arrested , i 'm telling them you all abducted me . '' \\n `` come on ! '' \\n i snapped . \\n i opened my door ; olivia and jack both winced at the cold . \\n `` hurry up-you two need to run . '' \\n `` i 'll come back to help you with him , '' isabel told me , and leaped out of the suv . \\n i turned back around to sam , who rolled his eyes up toward me . \\n he seemed disoriented , groggy . \\n i was momentarily frozen by his gaze , remembering sam lying in bed , nose to nose with me , eyes looking into mine . \\n he made a soft noise of anxiety . \\n `` i 'm sorry , '' i told him . \\n isabel returned , and i came around back to help her . \\n she pulled off her belt and expertly twisted it around sam 's muzzle . \\n i winced , but i could n't tell her not to . \\n she had n't been bitten and there was no guarantee of how sam would react to this process . \\n between the two of us , we lifted him and crab-walked to the clinic . \\n isabel kicked open the door , which was already slightly ajar . \\n `` the exam rooms are that way . \\n lock him in one of those and we 'll do olivia and jack first . \\n maybe he 'll turn back again , if he 's in the heat long enough . '' \\n isabel 's lie was extraordinarily kind ; we both knew he was n't changing without some kind of miracle . \\n the best i could hope for was that sam had been wrong-that this cure would n't kill him when he was a wolf . \\n i followed isabel to a little supply room , cluttered and stinking with a sort of medicinal , rubber scent . \\n olivia and jack were already waiting there , heads ducked together as if they were talking , which surprised me . \\n jack lifted his head when we came in . \\n `` i ca n't stand this waiting , '' he said . \\n `` can we just get this the hell over with ? '' \\n i looked at a bin of alcohol wipes . \\n `` do i need to prep his arm ? '' \\n isabel gave me a look . \\n `` we 're intentionally infecting him with meningitis . \\n it seems pointless to be worried about infection at the injection site . '' \\n i swabbed his arm , anyway , while isabel retrieved a bloodfilled syringe from the fridge . \\n `` oh , god , '' olivia whispered , her eyes frozen on the syringe . \\n we did n't have time to comfort her . \\n i took jack 's cold hand and turned it so that it was palm up , like i remembered seeing the nurse do before our rabies shots . \\n isabel looked at jack . \\n `` you 're sure you want this . '' \\n he lifted his teeth in a snarl . \\n he stank of fear . \\n `` just do it . '' \\n isabel hesitated ; it took me a moment to realize why . \\n `` let me do it , '' i told her . \\n `` he ca n't hurt me . '' \\n isabel handed me the syringe and ducked aside . \\n i took her place . \\n `` look the other way , '' i ordered jack . \\n he turned his head away . \\n i stuck the needle in , then smacked his face with my free hand as he jerked back around toward me . \\n `` control yourself ! '' \\n i snapped . \\n `` you 're not an animal . '' \\n he whispered , `` sorry . '' \\n i depressed the syringe fully , trying not to think too hard about the bloody contents of it , and pulled out the needle . \\n there was a dot of red at the injection site ; i did n't know if it was jack 's blood or infected blood from the syringe . \\n isabel was just staring at it , so i turned around , grabbed a band-aid , and stuck it over the site . \\n olivia let out a low moan . \\n `` thank you , '' jack said . \\n he hugged his arms around himself . \\n isabel looked sick . \\n `` just give me the other one , '' i said to isabel . \\n isabel handed it to me and we turned to olivia , who was so pale that i could see the vein running over her temple ; nerves shook her hands . \\n isabel took over my duty of swabbing the arm . \\n it was like an unspoken rule that we both had to feel useful to make the hateful task possible . \\n `` i changed my mind ! '' \\n olivia cried . \\n `` i do n't want to do it ! \\n i 'll take my chances ! '' \\n i took her hand . \\n `` olivia . \\n olive . \\n calm down . '' \\n `` i ca n't . '' \\n olivia 's eyes were on the dark red of the syringe . \\n `` i ca n't say that i 'd rather die than be this way . '' \\n i did n't know what to say . \\n i did n't want to convince her to do something that could kill her , but i did n't want her to not do it , out of fear . \\n `` but your whole life-olivia . '' \\n olivia shook her head . \\n `` no . \\n no , it 's not worth it . \\n let jack try it . \\n i 'll take my chances . \\n if it works on him , then i 'll try it . \\n but i. . . \\n ca n't . '' \\n `` you do know it 's nearly november , right ? '' \\n isabel demanded . \\n `` it 's freezing cold ! \\n you 're going to change soon for the winter , and we wo n't get another chance until spring . '' \\n `` just let her wait , '' jack snapped . \\n `` there 's no harm . \\n better her parents think she 's missing for a few months than find out she 's a werewolf . '' \\n `` please . '' \\n olivia 's eyes were full of tears . \\n i shrugged helplessly and put down the syringe . \\n i did n't know any more than she did . \\n and in my heart , i knew that , in her position , i 'd make the same choice-better to live with her beloved wolves than die of meningitis . \\n `` fine , '' isabel said . \\n `` jack , take olivia out to the car . \\n wait there and keep an eye out . \\n okay , grace . \\n let 's go see what sam 's done to the exam room while we were gone . '' \\n jack and olivia headed down the hallway , pressed against each other for warmth , trying not to shift , and isabel and i turned to go to the wolf who already had . \\n standing just outside the exam room where sam was , isabel put her hand on my arm , stopping me before i turned the door handle . \\n `` are you sure you want to do this ? '' \\n she asked . \\n `` it could kill him . \\n probably will kill him . '' \\n instead of answering , i pushed open the door . \\n in the ugly fluorescent lighting of the room , sam looked ordinary , doglike , small , crouched beside the exam table . \\n i knelt in front of him , wishing that we 'd thought of this possible cure before it was probably too late for him . \\n `` sam . '' \\n i do n't want to stand before you like a thing , shrewd , secretive ... i had known that the heat would n't change him back to human . \\n it was nothing but selfishness that had made me bring him to the clinic . \\n selfishness , and a fallible cure that could n't possibly work for him in this form . \\n `` sam , do you still want to do this ? '' \\n i touched his ruff , imagining it as his dark hair . \\n i swallowed unhappily . \\n sam whistled through his nose . \\n i had no idea how much he understood of what i said ; only that , in his semi-drugged state , he did n't flinch under my touch . \\n i tried again . \\n `` it could kill you . \\n do you still want to try ? '' \\n behind me , isabel coughed meaningfully . \\n sam whined at the noise , eyes jerking to isabel and the door . \\n i stroked his head and looked into his eyes . \\n god , they were the same . \\n it killed me to look at them now . \\n this has to work . \\n a tear slid down my face . \\n i did n't bother to swipe it away as i looked up at isabel . \\n i wanted this like i 'd never wanted anything . \\n `` we have to do it . '' \\n isabel did n't move . \\n `` grace , i do n't think he stands a chance unless he 's human . \\n i just do n't think it will work . '' \\n i ran a finger over the short , smooth hair on the side of his face . \\n if he had n't been sedated , he would n't have tolerated it , but the benadryl had dulled his instincts . \\n he closed his eyes . \\n it was unwolflike enough to give me hope . \\n `` grace . \\n are we doing this or not ? \\n seriously . '' \\n `` wait , '' i said . \\n `` i 'm trying something . '' \\n i settled on the floor and whispered to sam , `` i want you to listen to me , if you can . '' \\n i leaned the side of my face against his ruff and remembered the golden wood he had shown me so long ago . \\n i remembered the way the yellow leaves , the color of sam 's eyes , fluttered and twisted , crashing butterflies , on their way to the ground . \\n the slender white trunks of the birches , creamy and smooth as human skin . \\n i remembered sam standing in the middle of the wood , his arms stretched out , a dark , solid form in the dream of the trees . \\n his coming to me , me punching his chest , the soft kiss . \\n i remembered every kiss we 'd ever had , and i remembered every time i 'd curled in his human arms . \\n i remembered the soft warmth of his breath on the back of my neck while we slept . \\n i remembered sam . \\n i remembered him forcing himself out of wolf form for me . \\n to save me . \\n sam jerked away from me . \\n his head was lowered , tail between his legs , and he was shaking . \\n `` what 's happening ? '' \\n isabel 's hand was on the doorknob . \\n sam backed away farther , crashing into the cabinet behind him , curling into a ball , uncurling . \\n he was peeling free . \\n he was shaking out of his fur . \\n he was wolf and he was sam , and then he was just sam . \\n `` hurry , '' sam whispered . \\n he was jerking , hard , against the cabinet . \\n his fingers were claws on the tile . \\n `` hurry . \\n do it now . '' \\n isabel was frozen by the door . \\n `` isabel ! \\n come on ! '' \\n she snapped out of her spell and came over to us . \\n she crouched beside sam , next to the bare expanse of his back . \\n he was biting his lip so hard that it was bleeding . \\n i knelt , took his hand . \\n his voice was strained . \\n `` grace-hurry . \\n i 'm almost gone . '' \\n isabel did n't ask any more questions . \\n she just grabbed his arm , turned it , and jabbed the needle in . \\n she depressed the syringe halfway , but it jerked out of his arm as he seized violently . \\n sam backed away from me , tugging his hand from mine , and threw up . \\n `` sam - '' but he was gone . \\n in half the time it had taken him to become human , he was a wolf . \\n shaking , staggering , nails scratching on the tiles , falling to the floor . \\n `` i 'm sorry , grace , '' isabel said . \\n that was all she said . \\n she laid the syringe on the counter . \\n `` crap . \\n i hear jack . \\n i 'll be right back . '' \\n the door opened and closed . \\n i knelt next to sam 's body and buried my face in his fur . \\n his breaths were ragged and exhausted . \\n and all i could think was-i killed him . \\n this is going to kill him . \\n chapter sixty-one grace 36of jack was the one who opened the exam room door . \\n `` grace , come on . \\n we have to go-olivia 's not doing so good . '' \\n i stood , embarrassed to be found with tear-stained cheeks . \\n i turned to tip the used syringe into the hazardous waste container by the counter . \\n `` i need help carrying him . '' \\n he scowled at me . \\n `` that 's why isabel sent me in here . '' \\n i looked down , and my heart stopped . \\n empty floor . \\n i spun , ducking my head to look under the table . \\n `` sam ? '' \\n jack had left the door open . \\n the room was empty . \\n `` help me find him ! '' \\n i shouted at jack , pushing past him into the hallway . \\n there was no sign of sam . \\n as i pelted down the hall , i could see the door wide-open at the end of it , black night staring in . \\n it was the first place a wolf would 've run to , once his drugs wore off . \\n escape . \\n the night . \\n the cold . \\n i spun in the parking lot , looking for any sign of sam in the slender finger of boundary wood that stretched behind the clinic . \\n but it was darker than dark . \\n no lights . \\n no sound . \\n no sam . \\n `` sam ! '' \\n i knew he would n't come , even if he heard me . \\n sam was strong , but instincts were stronger . \\n it was intolerable to imagine him out there somewhere , half a vial of infected blood mixing slowly with his . \\n `` sam ! '' \\n my voice was a wail , a howl , a cry in the night . \\n he was gone . \\n headlights blinded me : isabel 's suv , tearing up beside me and shuddering to a stop . \\n isabel leaned over from the driver 's side and shoved open the passenger-side door , her face a ghost in the lights of the dashboard . \\n `` get in , grace . \\n hurry the hell up ! \\n olivia is changing and we 've been here way too long already . '' \\n i could n't leave him . \\n `` grace ! '' \\n jack climbed into the backseat , shuddering ; his eyes pleaded with me . \\n they were the same eyes i 'd seen at the very beginning , back when he 'd first been turned . \\n back before i 'd known anything at all . \\n i got in and slammed the door shut , looking out the window just in time to see a white wolf standing by the edge of the parking lot . \\n shelby . \\n alive , just like sam had thought . \\n i stared in the rearview mirror at her ; the wolf stood in the parking lot and gazed after us . \\n i thought i saw triumph in her eyes as she turned and disappeared into the darkness . \\n `` which wolf is that ? '' \\n isabel demanded . \\n but i could n't answer . \\n all i could think was sam , sam , sam . \\n chapter sixty-two grace 40of `` i do n't think jack 's doing well , '' olivia said . \\n she sat in the passenger seat of my new car , a little mazda that smelled like carpet cleaner and loneliness . \\n even though she wore two of my sweaters and a stocking cap , she was still shaking , her hands wrapped around her stomach . \\n `` if he was doing well , isabel would 've called us . '' \\n `` maybe , '' i said . \\n `` isabel is n't the calling sort . '' \\n but i could n't help but think she was right . \\n this was day three , and the last we 'd heard from isabel was eight hours ago . \\n day one : jack had a splitting headache and a stiff neck . \\n day two : headache worse . \\n running a temperature . \\n day three : isabel 's voicemail . \\n i pulled the mazda into beck 's driveway and parked behind isabel 's giant suv . \\n `` ready ? '' \\n olivia did n't look like she was , but she got out of the car and bolted for the front door . \\n i followed her in and shut the door behind us . \\n `` isabel ? '' \\n `` in here . '' \\n we followed her voice into one of the downstairs bedrooms . \\n it was a cheery yellow little bedroom that seemed at odds with the decomposing odor of sick that filled the space . \\n isabel sat cross-legged on a chair at the foot of the bed . \\n deep circles , like purple thumbprints , were pressed beneath her eyes . \\n i handed her the coffee we 'd brought . \\n `` why did n't you call us ? '' \\n isabel looked at me . \\n `` his fingers are dying . '' \\n i 'd been avoiding looking at him , but i did , finally , where he lay on the bed , curled like a half-done butterfly . \\n the ends of his fingertips were a disconcerting shade of blue . \\n his face was shiny with sweat , his eyes closed . \\n my throat felt too full . \\n `` i looked it up online , '' isabel told me . \\n she held up her phone , as if that explained everything . \\n `` his headache is because the lining of his brain is inflamed . \\n the fingers and toes are blue because his brain is n't telling his body to send blood there anymore . \\n i took his temperature . \\n it was one hundred and five . '' \\n olivia said , `` i have to throw up . '' \\n she left me in the room with isabel and jack . \\n i did n't know what to say . \\n if sam had been here , he would 've known the right thing to say . \\n `` i 'm sorry . '' \\n isabel shrugged , eyes dull . \\n `` it worked the way it was supposed to . \\n the first day , he almost changed into a wolf when the temperature dropped overnight . \\n that was the last time , even when the power went down last night . \\n i thought it was working . \\n he has n't changed since his fever got going . '' \\n she made a little gesture toward the bed . \\n `` did you make an excuse for me at school ? '' \\n `` yes . '' \\n `` fantastic . '' \\n i gestured for her to follow me . \\n she stood up from her chair as if it was difficult for her and trailed me into the hall . \\n i pulled the bedroom door almost shut so that jack , if he was listening , would n't overhear . \\n in a low voice , i said , `` we have to take him to the hospital , isabel . '' \\n isabel laughed-a weird , ugly sound . \\n `` and tell them what ? \\n he 's supposed to be dead . \\n you think i have n't been thinking about this ? \\n even if we give a fake name , his face has been all over the news for two months . '' \\n `` then we just take our chances , right ? \\n we 'll come up with some story . \\n i mean , we have to at least try , right ? '' \\n she looked up at me with her red-rimmed eyes for a long moment . \\n when she finally spoke , her voice was hollow . \\n `` do you think i want him to die ? \\n do n't you think i want to save him ? \\n it 's too late , grace ! \\n it 's hard for people to survive this kind of meningitis even if they 've gotten treatment from the very beginning . \\n right now , for him , after three days ? \\n i do n't even have painkillers to give him , much less anything that might do something for this . \\n i thought the wolf part might save him , like it saved you . \\n but he does n't have a chance . \\n not a chance . '' \\n i took the coffee cup out of her hands . \\n `` we ca n't just watch him die . \\n we 'll take him to a hospital that wo n't know him right away . \\n we 'll drive to duluth if we have to . \\n they wo n't recognize him there , at least not right away , and by then , we 'll have thought of something to tell them . \\n go clean up your face and get whatever of his stuff you want to bring . \\n come on , isabel . \\n move . '' \\n isabel still did n't answer , but she headed for the stairs . \\n after she 'd gone , i went into the downstairs bathroom and opened up the cupboard , thinking there might be something useful in there . \\n a houseful of people tended to accumulate a lot of meds . \\n there was some acetaminophen and some prescription pain pills from three years previously . \\n i took all of it and went back to jack 's room . \\n kneeling by his head , i said , `` jack , are you awake ? '' \\n i smelled puke on his breath and wondered at the hell he and isabel had been living in for the past three days ; it twisted my stomach . \\n i tried to convince myself that he somehow deserved this for making me lose sam , but i could n't . \\n it took a very long time for him to answer . \\n `` no . '' \\n `` can i do anything for you ? \\n to make you any more comfortable ? '' \\n his voice was very small . \\n `` my head 's killing me . '' \\n `` i have some pain pills . \\n do you think you can keep them down ? '' \\n he made a vaguely affirmative noise , so i took the glass of water from beside the bed and helped him swallow a couple of capsules . \\n he mumbled something that might 've been `` thank you . '' \\n i waited fifteen minutes , until the meds started to kick in , and watched his body relax a little . \\n somewhere , sam had this . \\n i imagined him lying somewhere , brain exploding with pain , fever ravaging , dying . \\n it seemed like , if something happened to sam , i ought to know it , in some way : feel a tiny prick of anguish the moment he died . \\n on the bed , jack made a small noise , an unintentional sound of pain , a little whimper in his fitful sleep . \\n all i could think of was injecting sam with the same blood . \\n in my head , i kept seeing isabel pushing it into his veins , a deadly cocktail . \\n `` i 'll be right back , '' i told jack , even though i thought he was sleeping . \\n i went out into the kitchen and found olivia leaning on the island , folding up a piece of paper . \\n `` how is he doing ? '' \\n she asked . \\n i shook my head . \\n `` we have to take him to the hospital . \\n can you come ? '' \\n olivia looked at me in a way that i could n't interpret . \\n `` i think i 'm ready . '' \\n she pushed the piece of folded paper toward me . \\n `` i need you to find a way to give that to my parents . '' \\n i started to open it and she shook her head . \\n i raised an eyebrow . \\n `` what is this ? '' \\n `` it 's the note telling them i 'm running away and not to try to find me . \\n they 'll still try , of course , but at least they wo n't think i was kidnapped or something . '' \\n `` you 're going to change . '' \\n it was n't a question . \\n she nodded and made another weird little face . \\n `` it 's getting really hard not to . \\n and-maybe it 's just because it 's so unpleasant , trying not to change-but i want to . \\n i 'm actually looking forward to it . \\n i know that sounds backward . '' \\n it did n't sound backward to me . \\n i would 've given anything to be in her place , to be with my wolves and with sam . \\n but i did n't want to tell her that , so i just asked the obvious question . \\n `` are you going to change here ? '' \\n olivia gestured for me to follow her into the kitchen and together we stood by the windows to the backyard . \\n `` i want you to see something . \\n look . \\n you have to wait a second . \\n but look . '' \\n we stood at the window , looking out at the dead winter world , into the tangled underbrush of the woods . \\n for a long moment i saw nothing but a small , colorless bird that fluttered from na ** d branch to na ** d branch . \\n then another slight movement caught my eye , lower to the ground , and i saw a big , dark wolf in the woods . \\n his light , nearly colorless eyes were on the house . \\n `` i do n't know how they know , '' olivia said , `` but i feel like they 're waiting for me . '' \\n i suddenly realized that the expression on her face was excitement . \\n it made me feel oddly alone . \\n `` you want to go now , do n't you ? '' \\n olivia nodded . \\n `` i ca n't stand waiting anymore . \\n i ca n't wait to let go . '' \\n i sighed and looked at her eyes , very green and bright . \\n i had to memorize them now so that i could recognize them later . \\n i thought i ought to say something to her , but i could n't think of what . \\n `` i 'll give your letter to your parents . \\n be careful . \\n i 'll miss you , olive . '' \\n i slid open the glass door ; cold air blasted us . \\n she actually laughed as the wind ripped a shiver from her . \\n she was a strange , light creature that i did n't recognize . \\n `` see you in the spring , grace . '' \\n and she ran out into the yard , stripping sweaters as she did , and before she got to the tree line , she was a light , light wolf , joyful and leaping . \\n there was none of the pain of jack 's or sam 's change-it was as if she had been meant for it . \\n something in my stomach twisted at the sight of her . \\n sadness , or envy , or happiness . \\n it was just the three of us then , the three of us who did n't change . \\n i started the car 's engine to warm it , but in the end it did n't matter . \\n fifteen minutes later , jack died . \\n now it was just the two of us . \\n chapter sixty-three grace 22of i saw olivia after that , after i 'd left her note on her parents ' car . \\n she moved lightly in the twilight woods , her green eyes making her instantly identifiable . \\n she was never alone ; other wolves guided her , taught her , guarded her from the primitive dangers of the desolate winter wood . \\n i wanted to ask her if she 'd seen him . \\n i think she wanted to tell me `` no . '' \\n isabel called me a few days before christmas break and my planned trip with rachel . \\n i did n't know why she called me instead of just coming over to my new car ; i could see her right across the school parking lot , sitting in her suv by herself . \\n `` how are you doing ? '' \\n she asked . \\n `` i 'm okay , '' i replied . \\n `` liar . '' \\n isabel did n't look at me . \\n `` you know he 's dead . '' \\n it was easier to admit on the phone , rather than face-to-face . \\n `` i know . '' \\n across the frosty gray parking lot , isabel snapped her phone shut . \\n i heard her put her suv in gear and then she drove it to where i stood by my car . \\n there was a click as she unlocked the passenger-side door and a whirr as the window rolled down . \\n `` get in . \\n let 's go somewhere . '' \\n we went downtown and bought coffee , and then , because there was a parking place in front , we went to the bookstore . \\n isabel looked at the storefront for a long time before getting out of the car . \\n we stood on the icy sidewalk and stared at the display window . \\n it was all christmas stuff . \\n reindeer and gingerbread and it 's a wonderful life . \\n `` jack loved christmas , '' isabel said . \\n `` i think it 's a stupid holiday . \\n i 'm not celebrating it anymore . '' \\n she gestured to the store . \\n `` do you want to go in ? \\n i have n't been in here in weeks . '' \\n `` i have n't been here since - '' i stopped . \\n i did n't want to say it . \\n i wanted to go in , but i did n't want to have to say it . \\n isabel opened the door for me . \\n `` i know . '' \\n the bookstore was a different world in this gray , dead winter . \\n the shelves , blue and slate , had taken on a different hue . \\n the light was pure , pure white . \\n classical music played overhead , but the hum of the heater was the real soundtrack . \\n i looked at the kid behind the counter-dark haired , lanky , bent over a book-and for a moment , a lump rose in my throat , too thick to swallow . \\n isabel wrenched my arm , hard enough to hurt . \\n `` let 's find books on getting fat . '' \\n we went to the cookbook section and sat on the floor . \\n the carpet was cold . \\n isabel made a huge mess , pulling out a stack next to her and putting them back in the wrong order , and i lost myself in the neat letters of the titles on the spines , absently pulling the books out so that they were flush with one another . \\n `` i want to learn how to get fat , '' isabel said . \\n she handed me a book on pastries . \\n `` how does that look ? '' \\n i paged through it . \\n `` all the measurements are in metric . \\n and no cups . \\n you 'd have to get a digital scale . '' \\n `` forget that . '' \\n isabel put it back in the wrong place . \\n `` try this one . '' \\n this one was all on cakes . \\n beautiful chocolate layers bursting with raspberries , yellow sponges smothered with fluffy buttercream , cloying cheesecakes drizzled with strawberry nectar . \\n `` you ca n't take a piece of cake with you to school . '' \\n i handed her a book on cookies and bars . \\n `` try that . '' \\n `` this is perfect , '' isabel accused , and set the book aside in a different pile . \\n `` do n't you know how to shop ? \\n being efficient is n't a good thing . \\n it does n't take enough time . \\n i 'm going to have to teach you the art of browsing . \\n you 're clearly deficient . '' \\n isabel taught me browsing in the cookbook section until i was restless , and then i left her behind and wandered through the store . \\n i did n't want to , but i climbed the burgundy-carpeted stairs to the loft . \\n the snow-clouded day outside made the loft seem darker and even smaller than it had before , but the love seat was still there , and the little waist-high bookshelves sam had searched through . \\n i could still see the shape of his body curled in front of them , looking for the perfect book . \\n i should n't have , but i sat on the couch and lay back on it . \\n i closed my eyes and pretended as hard as i could that sam was lying behind me , that i was secure in his arms , and that any moment i would feel his breath move my hair and tickle my ear . \\n i could almost smell him here , if i tried hard enough . \\n there were n't many places that still held his scent , but i could almost detect it-or maybe i just wanted to so badly that i was imagining it . \\n i remembered him urging me to smell everything in the candy shop . \\n to give in to who i really was . \\n i picked out the scents in the bookstore now : the nutty aroma of the leather , the almost perfumey carpet cleaner , the sweet black ink and the gasoline-smelling color inks , the shampoo of the boy at the counter , isabel 's fragrance , the scent of the memory of me and sam kissing on this couch . \\n i did n't want isabel to find me with my tears any more than she wanted me to find her with hers . \\n we shared a lot of things now , but crying was one thing we never talked about . \\n i wiped my face dry with my sleeve and sat up . \\n i walked to the shelf where sam had gotten his book , scanned the titles until i recognized it , then pulled the volume out . \\n poems by rainer maria rilke . \\n i lifted it to my nose to see if it was the same copy . \\n sam . \\n i bought it . \\n isabel bought the cookbook on cookies , and we went to rachel 's place and baked six dozen thumbprint cookies while carefully not talking about sam or olivia . \\n afterward , isabel drove me home and i shut myself in the study with rilke , and i read and i wanted . \\n and leaving you -lrb- there are n't words to untangle it -rrb- your life , fearful and immense and blossoming , so that , sometimes frustrated , and sometimes understanding , your life is sometimes a stone in you , and then , a star . \\n i was beginning to understand poetry . \\n chapter sixty-four grace it was n't christmas without my wolf . \\n it was the one time of year i 'd always had him , a silent presence lingering at the edge of the woods . \\n so many times , i 'd stood by the kitchen window , my hands smelling of ginger and nutmeg and pine and one hundred other christmas smells , and felt his gaze on me . \\n i 'd look up to see sam standing at the edge of the woods , golden eyes steady and unblinking . \\n not this year . \\n i stood at the kitchen window , my hands smelling of nothing . \\n no point baking christmas cookies or trimming a tree this year ; in twenty-four hours , i 'd be gone for two weeks with rachel . \\n on a white florida beach , far away from mercyfalls . \\n far away from boundary wood , and most of all , far away from the empty backyard . \\n i slowly rinsed out my travel cup , and for the thousandth time this winter , lifted up my gaze to look to the woods . \\n there was nothing but trees in shades of gray , their snowladen branches etched against a heavy winter sky . \\n the only color was the brilliant flash of a male cardinal , flapping to the bird feeder . \\n he pecked at the empty wooden base before wheeling away , a red spot against a white sky . \\n i did n't want to go out into the backyard with its unmarked snow , devoid of pawprints , but i did n't want to leave the feeder empty while i was gone , either . \\n retrieving the bag of birdseed from under the kitchen sink , i pulled on my coat , my hat , my gloves . \\n i went to the back door and slid it open . \\n the scent of the winter woods hit me hard , reminding me fiercely of every christmas that had ever mattered . \\n even though i knew i was alone , i still shivered . \\n chapter sixty-five sam i watched her . \\n i was a ghost in the woods , silent , still , cold . \\n i was winter embodied , the frigid wind given physical form . \\n i stood near the edge of the woods , where the trees began to thin , and scented the air : mostly dead smells to find this time of the season . \\n the bite of conifer , the musk of wolf , the sweetness of her , nothing else to smell . \\n she stood in the doorway for the space of several breaths . \\n her face was turned toward the trees , but i was invisible , intangible , nothing but eyes in the woods . \\n the intermittent breeze carried her scent to me again and again , singing in another language of memories from another form . \\n finally , finally , she stepped onto the deck and pressed the first footprint into the snow of the yard . \\n and i was right here , almost right within reach , but still one thousand miles away . \\n chapter sixty-six grace every step i took toward the feeder took me closer to the woods . \\n i smelled the crisp leaves of the undergrowth , shallow creeks moving sluggishly beneath a crust of ice , summer lying dormant in unnumbered skeleton trees . \\n something about the trees reminded me of the wolves howling at night , and that reminded me of the golden wood of my dreams , hidden now under a blanket of snow . \\n i missed the woods so much . \\n i missed him . \\n i turned my back to the trees and set the bag of birdseed on the ground beside me . \\n all i had to do was fill the feeder and go back inside and pack my bags to fly away with rachel , where i could try to forget every secret that hid inside these winter woods . \\n chapter sixty-seven sam i watched her . \\n she had n't noticed me yet . \\n she was knock , knock , knocking ice off the bird feeder . \\n slowly and automatically following the steps to clean it and open it and fill it and close it and just look at it as if it was the most important thing in the world . \\n i watched her . \\n waited for her to turn and glimpse my dark form in the woods . \\n she pulled her hat down over her ears , blew out a puff of breath to watch it swirl a cloud in the air . \\n she clapped the snow from her gloves and turned to go . \\n i could n't hide anymore . \\n i blew out a long breath as well . \\n it was a faint noise , but her head turned immediately toward it . \\n her eyes found the mist of my breath , and then me as i stepped through it , slow , cautious , unsure of how she would react . \\n she froze . \\n perfectly still , like a deer . \\n i kept approaching , making hesitant , careful prints in the snow , until i was out of the woods and i was standing right in front of her . \\n she was as silent as i was , and perfectly still . \\n her lower lip shook . \\n when she blinked , three shining tears left crystal tracks on her cheeks . \\n she could 've looked at the tiny miracles in front of her : my feet , my hands , my fingers , the shape of my shoulders beneath my jacket , my human body , but she only stared at my eyes . \\n the wind whipped again , through the trees , but it had no force , no power over me . \\n the cold bit at my fingers , but they stayed fingers . \\n `` grace , '' i said , very softly . \\n `` say something . '' \\n `` sam , '' she said , and i crushed her to me .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"domain\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 16,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Adventure\",\n          \"Mystery\",\n          \"Fantasy\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":4}],"source":["df.head(10)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":5,"id":"da960ac5-5773-4b39-bb28-3835d6cb8e8a","metadata":{"id":"da960ac5-5773-4b39-bb28-3835d6cb8e8a","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1725036858768,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":801,"user":{"displayName":"Ajaidev S","userId":"00331899201904083157"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["test=df['text'].tolist()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":6,"id":"ba92ea63-b63b-402f-8679-2c04a2aee7a7","metadata":{"scrolled":true,"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"collapsed":true,"id":"ba92ea63-b63b-402f-8679-2c04a2aee7a7","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1725036862729,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":989,"user":{"displayName":"Ajaidev S","userId":"00331899201904083157"}},"outputId":"4c8869a3-9831-4057-fc09-9fcee9255900"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["amanda martin two-hundred steps home volume five amanda martin was born in hertfordshire in 1976 . \n"," after graduating with first class honours from leeds university she wandered around the world trying to find her place in it . \n"," she tried various roles , in england and new zealand , including bar manager , marketing manager , consultant and artist , before deciding that writer/mummy best summed her up . \n"," she lives in northamptonshire with her husband , two children and labradoodle kara and can mostly be found at http://writermummy.wordpress.com or on twitter or facebook . \n"," two-hundred steps home is her latest work . \n"," amanda is writing the novel in daily instalments on her writermummy blog as part of her 2013 365 post-a-day challenge . \n"," this ebook is volume 5 and contains the 31 instalments from may . \n"," to catch up on earlier volumes visit smashwords . \n"," copyright published by 3ad publishing at smashwords copyright © amanda martin 2013 amanda martin asserts the moral right to be identified as the author of this work also by amanda martin : two-hundred steps home : the complete journey dragon wraiths baby blues and wedding shoes this novel is entirely a work of fiction although based loosely on the yha hostels of england and wales . \n"," the names , characters and incidents portrayed in it are the work of the author 's imagination . \n"," any resemblance to actual persons , living or dead , events or localities is entirely coincidental . \n"," all rights reserved . \n"," thank you for downloading this free ebook . \n"," although this is a free book , it remains the copyrighted property of the author , and may not be reproduced , copied and distributed for commercial or non-commercial purposes . \n"," if you enjoyed this book , please encourage your friends to download their own copy at smashwords.com , where they can also discover other works by this author . \n"," thank you for your support . \n"," http://www.amanda-martin.co.uk http://writermummy.wordpress.com table of contents title copyright one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty twenty-one twenty-two twenty-three twenty-four twenty-five twenty-six twenty-seven twenty-eight twenty-nine thirty thirty-one about the author one `` kim , jeff , over here !

'' \n"," the line on kim 's face deepened and claire 's earlier suspicions returned . \n"," they grew in strength as kim shook her head and smiled a little ruefully . \n"," `` you 're not really selling the whole parenting thing to me . '' \n"," claire felt her heart jump into her throat . \n"," she wondered if she was brave enough to probe . \n"," kim did n't push me for answers about michael ; i should probably keep my mouth shut and let her tell me in her own time . \n"," there was a pause , both women watching the sleeping child . \n"," kim sucked in air as if steeling herself for a difficult challenge . \n"," `` claire , i -- '' `` hello , ladies , are you hungry ? '' \n"," kim and claire turned to face the door together , like rabbits starting at the sound of danger . \n"," `` shhh , jeff , you 'll wake sky , '' kim hissed , her face flushed red . \n"," jeff narrowed his eyes and looked directly at his girlfriend . \n"," a sense of what he had interrupted seemed to occur to him , and he raised a hand , smiling apologetically . \n"," `` sorry . '' \n"," holding up a thin white carrier bag laden with boxes , he shrugged sheepishly . \n"," `` chinese ? '' \n"," when they had eaten more than their fill , they stretched back on the sofas , cradling their swollen bellies . \n"," claire instinctively looked towards her friend , trying to gauge whether her belly was more rounded than could be explained by too much take-away . \n"," kim was snuggled next to jeff , curled into his shoulder in such a pose of belonging it made claire 's heart contract like withered fruit . \n"," she remembered why she did n't spend much time with kim when her boyfriend was around . \n"," not only was he too good looking for comfort , he was also completely absorbed in kim to the exclusion of anything else . \n"," when she had been with michael it made the arguments all the more painful . \n"," now , knowing that the only person sharing her life and bed was a six-year-old girl who would return to her mother in a week , claire felt the pain like a cavernous empty space in her soul . \n"," out in the hills , with a destination to distract her and the feel of the sun and wind to keep her company , the loneliness did n't bite . \n"," sitting in the quiet lounge , with guest huddled together reading , playing scrabble , or just existing in each other 's orbit , claire felt smothered by how much it hurt . \n"," unable to bear it , she rolled off the sofa , weariness dragging at her limbs . \n"," she stretched , then walked over and gathered the sleeping child into her arms , glad of the warmth . \n"," with a nod at jeff and a smile to kim , she cradled sky close and carried her away to bed . \n"," *** three `` over here , jeff ! \n"," your ball 's in the grass . '' \n"," sky giggled and span round , making her skirt flare in the wind . \n"," as jeff walked over to retrieve his missing golf ball she smiled shyly up at him , then ran forwards and hugged his leg . \n"," `` blimey . \n"," is she normally that forward with strange men ? '' \n"," kim 's voice sounded disapproving and claire raised an eyebrow . \n"," `` it 's not really forward when you 're six . \n"," she 's not flirting . '' \n"," `` she so is ! '' \n"," claire laughed . \n"," `` are you jealous of a six-year-old , kim ? \n"," you know jeff only has eyes for you . '' \n"," `` exactly , '' she pouted . \n"," `` he 's never flirted with anyone else before . '' \n"," `` kim , she 's six . '' \n"," claire stood with her hands on her hips , her head tilted to one side . \n"," then both girls collapsed into giggles and linked arms happily . \n"," `` it 's great to see that sky 's relaxed with jeff . \n"," i was n't sure how she would be with strangers . '' \n"," claire remembered their meeting with sky 's dad the day before . \n"," `` and her life is pretty messy right now . '' \n"," certainly sky and jeff had been giggling together like old friends since they 'd started their game of crazy golf . \n"," it meant that she was able to relax for the first time since taking charge of her niece , and hang back with kim . \n"," hopefully she 'll spill the beans , with the other two out of the way . \n"," they followed on behind as sky tried to scoop her ball into a hole . \n"," it 's not really crazy golf , claire thought . \n"," where are the windmills and silly tunnels to put the ball through ? \n"," she looked around at the pirates hanging from the rigging and the barrels of rum . \n"," not that sky seems to care . \n"," she is flirting with jeff , little madam . \n"," maybe that 's what you do when you 're six . \n"," i ca n't say i remember . \n"," if i 'd opened my eyes all wide and winsome like that at my dad 's colleagues i 'd have been sent to my room . \n"," the sun shone down on the bright green fairway . \n"," if you call it that in crazy golf . \n"," claire had no idea ; it was her first foray into the world of the sport , crazy or otherwise . \n"," it had been jeff 's suggestion and sky had readily agreed , before asking the classic kid 's question , `` what is crazy golf , auntie claire ? '' \n"," claire felt the weight of kim 's arm through hers , and the wide gulf of space that seemed to separate them , despite the closeness . \n"," maybe i am going to have to pry . \n"," after jeff 's untimely entrance last night i do n't think she 's going to open up again . \n"," she searched her mind for a way to open the conversation without jumping to conclusions . \n"," `` how are rehearsals coming on ? \n"," do you have puck memorised now ? '' \n"," kim nodded . \n"," `` yes , i think so . \n"," it 's been fun , and it beats some of the other roles i 've done . \n"," at least i have n't had to murder my way through a terrible hull accent . \n"," claire thought about kim 's last role , playing a northern woman who worked at a fish factory and sang tony christie songs , and her eyes sparkled . \n"," `` i thought your accent was quite good . '' \n"," `` you have to say that because you 're my best friend . \n"," that woman from the paper said i was worse than dick van dyke in mary poppins . \n"," that is an insult ! '' \n"," `` ah well , maybe you wo n't have to do accents again . '' \n"," kim lowered her head and sighed . \n"," `` maybe i wo n't get a chance to do acting again . '' \n"," `` what do you mean ? '' \n"," claire tried to sound casual , but her heart thumped loudly in her ears . \n"," there was silence , filled with the sound of laughter as jeff 's ball skipped over the hole and disappeared from view . \n"," claire tried to keep her breathing even and resist the urge to fill the void with words . \n"," eventually the stillness was broken by a tiny sob and claire turned to see tears streaming down her friend 's face . \n"," `` oh honey , what is it ? '' \n"," `` jeff and i ... we 're going to get married . '' \n"," claire reeled at the unexpected response . \n"," struggling to keep up , she pulled kim over to sit on some rocks and offered her a tissue . \n"," `` is that a reason to cry ? \n"," why now ? \n"," i thought you were going to wait until you could afford a lavish do ? '' \n"," kim nodded and gulped down more tears , scrubbing at the ones already staining her cheeks . \n"," `` we were . \n"," but now ... '' she looked up and away , avoiding claire 's penetrating stare . \n"," `` now everything has changed . '' \n"," kim glanced back at her friend , then sunk her head into her hands . \n"," `` i 'm pregnant . '' \n"," the words were muffled by her hands , but claire was expecting them . \n"," even so , having it said out loud made it too real . \n"," the words that sprang into her throat were the obvious ones -- how ? \n"," what happened ? \n"," how could you be so careless ? \n"," the kind of things her mother would say , and not at all helpful . \n"," she drew in a deep breath and tried to imagine what she would want to hear , if the situation was reversed . \n"," it was hard to think , knowing the situation would never have arisen for her , and seeing in her mind also how overjoyed michael would have been if it had . \n"," `` what does jeff think ? '' \n"," kim looked up , eyes awash , and smiled . \n"," `` he 's thrilled . \n"," look at him , '' she jerked her chin over to where jeff was teaching sky how to putt . \n"," `` he loves kids . \n"," and it 's not going to wreck his career or his body . '' \n"," `` ah . '' \n"," as if the girls had suddenly become telepathic , claire could hear the hours of wrangling debate that had already taken place -- either in kim 's head or with jeff . \n"," knowing she did n't really believe it , claire said what had to be said . \n"," `` it wo n't ruin either thing : plenty of women have babies every day . \n"," actresses , models , long-distance runners . \n"," they go back to what they love doing afterwards . \n"," or ... '' she hesitated , not wanting to suggest what might be unthinkable . \n"," the telepathic bond held strong and kim shook her head , red hair whipping round with the movement . \n"," `` i 'm not getting rid of it . \n"," no way . \n"," it would destroy jeff , and my mother would never speak to me again . '' \n"," silence fell , punctuated only with happy chatter and bird song . \n"," claire reached for kim 's hand and squeezed it tight . \n"," there were a hundred things she wanted to say , to ask . \n"," she sensed that kim 's head was full of the same questions and that they haunted her . \n"," remembering what it was like to live with an argument in your head for any length of time , claire forced herself to be silent and let that be enough . \n"," *** four `` how many weeks gone are you ? '' \n"," kim and claire sat watching as sky and jeff fought over the last hole . \n"," no words had been spoken since kim 's revelation , but claire wanted to reassure her friend that she had her full support . \n"," `` sixteen . '' \n"," claire did a quick mental calculation . \n"," four months , already ? \n"," the baby will be due in september . \n"," she shivered . \n"," trying to hide her unease , claire smiled at kim . \n"," `` you 're not showing . \n"," when did you find out ? '' \n"," `` two weeks ago . '' \n"," `` and you did n't tell me ? '' \n"," claire could hear the hurt in her voice . \n"," `` how could i ? \n"," we always said we would build up our careers before we had kids . \n"," if we ever had them at all . '' \n"," something in her voice suggested maybe she had n't been as clear on the latter point as claire . \n"," `` besides , '' she continued , her voice low , `` i needed to decide what i was going to do before i told anyone . '' \n"," claire thought about her friend going through that decision process alone . \n"," not alone . \n"," with jeff . \n"," `` how did jeff take that ? '' \n"," following on from what kim had said earlier , she imagined him pressuring kim to keep the baby . \n"," `` he said he would support me , either way . \n"," it was n't planned . \n"," we always said we would get married first and see where we were then . \n"," but now ... '' something else her friend had said came back to claire . \n"," `` but now you 're getting married and having a baby . '' \n"," she had n't meant to sound accusatory , but she felt kim flinch away from her words . \n"," `` sorry . \n"," i did n't mean that how it sounded . \n"," my brain is still catching up . '' \n"," there was a pause , then kim sighed again . \n"," `` that 's okay . \n"," it 's taking a while for me to catch up and i 've had longer to think about it . \n"," yes , we 're going to get married . \n"," jeff 's family are quite traditional and , though his mother has n't said anything , i know they 'd be happier if the baby was n't born out of wedlock . '' \n"," claire tried to imagine what her parents would think about it and realised she had no idea . \n"," probably they would think the same and force her to have some hideously formal event at the country club . \n"," `` when 's the wedding ? \n"," will you have a big do ? '' \n"," `` we ca n't afford it . \n"," jeff 's wages are more than mine , but only just . \n"," actually , your blog has given us an idea . \n"," we thought we might see if we could hire one of the smaller hostels and invite all our friends for the weekend . \n"," ask them to pay for their room instead of bringing a gift . \n"," what do you think ? '' \n"," `` i think it sounds brilliant . \n"," there are some gorgeous buildings , '' she gave kim a cheeky grin , `` and i can write about it for my blog ! '' \n"," *** five `` have you booked a date for the wedding ? \n"," i 'm guessing it will have to be soon , not that you 're showing . '' \n"," claire leaned back in the sand and looked over at her friend . \n"," kim laughed , patting her flat stomach . \n"," `` i am : i just breathe in ! \n"," i have to hope the baby does n't get too big before the show 's finished . \n"," our director will have a fit . \n"," we 'll be a laughing stock if the audience notices puck is pregnant . '' \n"," `` that does n't seem right : are n't there rules about discrimination these days ? \n"," surely he or she will be applauded for their political correctness . '' \n"," `` there is n't much political correctness in the acting world , my dear . \n"," i 'll be considered too old for many roles in a year or two . \n"," i 'm lucky i 'm petite and slim , it hides my age . \n"," not that i 'll be slim for long . '' \n"," she frowned and stared down the beach , where jeff and sky were engaged in a sandcastle competition . \n"," sky was cheating , flattening jeff 's castles every time he went to collect water or shells . \n"," `` you make it sound like we 're ancient . '' \n"," claire shielded her eyes from the afternoon sun . \n"," `` actually i feel pretty ancient , although at least sky has n't had nightmares for a day or two . \n"," i think i actually got six hours sleep last night . '' \n"," `` is it really so bad ? '' \n"," kim 's voice suggested she did n't really want to know the answer . \n"," `` being a parent , i mean .

'' \n"," sky tried to remember what pregnant women in the office had wittered on about in the past . \n"," she mostly tuned out their chatter , but some of it had obviously gone in . \n"," `` oh yes , there are classes , but they seem to be about getting through labour and keeping the kid alive for the first few months . \n"," what about after that ? \n"," there do n't seem to be any lessons on how to deal with it when they flirt with your friend 's boyfriend ...
